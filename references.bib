abstract = {Abstract One of the main biosecurity problems facing banana crops is black Sigatoka disease, caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis. Disease control is achieved mainly by chemical sprays and generates more than 50\% of the costs of production, with a trend to increase due to the rapid resistance that the fungus acquires to the main fungicide molecules. Thus, it is very important to acquire information on the molecular mechanisms of the plant–pathogen interactions in this pathosystem as a way to help design future control strategies. Hormonal plant responses of banana genotypes susceptible and resistant to P. fijiensis were identified and analysed in this work by transcriptomic (RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR) and metabolomic studies (ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy). Differentially expressed genes related to signal transduction and biosynthesis pathways of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) were identified in the resistant variety Calcutta 4 during the early stage of interaction with P. fijiensis. Metabolomic analysis corroborated the induction of metabolites related to JA and ET pathways during the first 72 hr post-inoculation. Observed results are evidence that signalling via JA/ET could be key in the activation of defence response signals in the resistant variety Calcutta 4.},

    abstract = {Motivation: RNA-seq is replacing microarrays as the primary tool for gene expression studies. Many RNA-seq studies have used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources.Results: We show the explicit trade-off between more biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the human cell line MCF7, adding more sequencing depth after 10 M reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes, whereas adding biological replicates improves power significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of large-scale RNA-seq DE studies. Our analysis showed that sequencing less reads and performing more biological replication is an effective strategy to increase power and accuracy in large-scale differential expression RNA-seq studies, and provided new insights into efficient experiment design of RNA-seq studies.Availability and implementation: The code used in this paper is provided on: http://home.uchicago.edu/∼jiezhou/replication/.
