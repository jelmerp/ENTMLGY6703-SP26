    "text": "2 The files you’ll work with\nThe main data files in a reference-based HTS project1 are sequence reads (usually produced for the focal project) and reference genome files (usually already available).\nYou’ve seen some of these files in the first part of this lab, but we didn’t pay much attention to what they represent. Let’s get an overview of the full set of files using the tree command (with the option -C to show colors):\n# Make sure you're in the right dir (you may already be there)\ncd /fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/share\n# Unlike ls, tree will show the full directory structure\ntree -C\n# (The colors you should see in the terminal aren't shown here)\n  .\n  └── data\n      ├── fastq\n      │   ├── ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz\n      │   ├── ERR10802863_R2.fastq.gz\n      │   ├── ERR10802864_R1.fastq.gz\n      │   ├── ERR10802864_R2.fastq.gz\n      │   ├── [...truncated - more FASTQ files...]\n      ├── meta\n      │   └── metadata.tsv\n      └── ref\n          ├── GCF_016801865.2.fna\n          └── GCF_016801865.2.gtf\n  4 directories, 47 files\nSo, we have:\n\nA whole bunch of FASTQ files (.fastq.gz extension) which contain the HTS reads\nTwo reference genomes files representing the assembly/sequence (.fna) and the annotation table (.gtf)\nA sample metadata file with treatment information for each sample\n\nAll these files are plain-text files, which is one reason why the Unix shell excells at working with them. You’ll take a closer look at each below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: How would you go about to retrieve this data? (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the Garrigós et al. (2025) paper, there is a section called “Open Research” with a “Data Availability Statement”, which reads:\n\nRaw sequences generated in this study have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive ENA database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) under project accession number PRJEB41609, Study ERP125411. Sample metadata are available at https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/15708.\n\nThe project accession number PRJEB41609 can be used to download the reads in various ways. Because of the large amount of data involved, it’s convenient to download them directly to OSC rather than first to your own computer. One way to do this is to use the SRA Explorer website, where you can enter the project accession number and get download links so you can download the files with simple commands.\nThe second link can be used to download the sample metadata.\n\n\n\n\n2.1 The sample metadata\nLet’s start by taking a quick look at a table with information about the samples analyzed in this paper, which we’ll call the sample metadata. This file, metadata.tsv, is a small tabular plain-text file, with columns separated by Tabs (TSV/.tsv is short for “Tab-Separated Values”):\nls -lh data/meta\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 644 Jan 21 09:15 metadata.tsv\nYou can find this file in the file explorer in the VS Code side bar, and click on it to open it in the editor. Alternatively, you can use the cat command to show the file contents in the shell:\ncat data/meta/metadata.tsv\nsample_id    time   treatment\nERR10802882  10_d   cathemerium\nERR10802875  10_d   cathemerium\nERR10802879  10_d   cathemerium\nERR10802883  10_d   cathemerium\nERR10802878  10_d   control\nERR10802884  10_d   control\nERR10802877  10_d   control\nERR10802881  10_d   control\nERR10802876  10_d   relictum\nERR10802880  10_d   relictum\nERR10802885  10_d   relictum\nERR10802886  10_d   relictum\nERR10802864  24_h   cathemerium\nERR10802867  24_h   cathemerium\nERR10802870  24_h   cathemerium\nERR10802866  24_h   control\nERR10802869  24_h   control\nERR10802863  24_h   control\nERR10802871  24_h   relictum\nERR10802874  24_h   relictum\nERR10802865  24_h   relictum\nERR10802868  24_h   relictum\nThere are 22 samples in total, with two variables of interest: time of sampling after infection, and treatment group (infection status). Each treatment-time combination has replicates to allow for statistical comparisons. Again, we’ll discuss these aspects in more detail next week."

    "section": "3 Reference genome files",
    "text": "3 Reference genome files\nThe two main types of reference genome files needed for a HTS project like reference-based RNA-Seq are:\n\nThe genome assembly, i.e. the nucleotide sequence of each chromosome/scaffold. These are stored in the simple FASTA format.\nThe genome annotation, i.e. a table with the positions of genes and other genomic features on each chromosome/scaffold. These are commonly stored in GTF or similar formats.\n\nBoth of these are plain-text file formats. Below, after seeing how you can obtain such files, we’ll focus on exploring the genome assembly FASTA file.\n\n3.1 Finding your reference genome\nImagine you are one of the researchers involved in the Culex study. You would want to see if there’s a Cx. pipiens reference genome available, and if so, download the relevant files. The authors state the following in the paper (section 2.3, “Data analysis”):\n\nBecause the reference genome and annotations of Cx. pipiens are not published yet, we used the reference genome and annotations of phylogenetically closest species that were available in Ensembl, Cx. quinquefasciatus.\n\nBut perhaps that genome of Cx. pipiens has been published in the meantime?\nGenerally, the first place to look for reference genome data is at NCBI, https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, where you can start by simply typing the name of your organism in the search box at the home page. By means of example, let’s first search for the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this species, we get the following “card” at the top of the results:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you next click on “Genomes” in the result page above, you should get the following2:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, NCBI has 5 genomes assemblies for Episyrphus balteatus. The top one:\n\nHas a green check mark next to it, which means that this genome has been designated the primary reference genome for the focal organism.\nIs the only one with an entry in the RefSeq column, which means it has an (NCBI) annotation available.\n\nTherefore, that top assembly, idEpiBalt1.1, would be the one to go with.\n\n Exercise: A Culex pipiens reference genome\n\nNow search for Culex pipiens, and do a genus-wide search. How many Culex pipiens are on NCBI, and if so, which would you pick?\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\nGo through the same process as shown above for the fruitfly, now entering Culex in the search box.\nYou should find that there are 5 Culex pipiens assemblies. Very much like for the fruitfly, as it happens, the first one (TS_CPP_V2) is the only with a reference checkmark next to it and an entry in the RefSeq column:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, there is currently a reference genome for Cx. pipiens available, and we’ll be using that one: the files you saw earlier in data/ref are for that genome.\n\nYou can click on each assembly to get more information, including statistics like the number of scaffolds. Take a closer look at our focal genome on the NCBI website. What is the size of the genome assembly? How many chromosomes and scaffolds does it contain? And how many protein-coding genes?\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\nOn the genome’s page at NCBI, some of the information includes the following stats on the assembly and the annotation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the genome…\n\nhas a size of 566.3 Mb (Megabases)\ncontains 3 chromosomes and 289 unplaced scaffolds\nhas 16,297 protein-coding genes annotated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: Downloading reference genome files (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanted to download the reference genome files from the NCBI website, you could either select an assembly in the overview table and click the Download button, or click the Download button at the top of the page for a specific assembly. That should get you the following pop-up window:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll want to select at least the “Genome sequences (FASTA)” and one or both of the “Annotation features” files (GTF is often preferred with RNA-Seq).\nThis allows you to download the data to your computer, and you could then upload it OSC. Though a faster and more reproducible solution would be to use a command in your OSC shell to directly download these — the datasets and curl buttons next to the Download one a genome’s page help with that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: Reference genome complications (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nOther useful database for reference genomes are Ensembl and specialized databases that exist for certain organisms, like FlyBase for Drosophila, VectorBase mostly for mosquitos, and JGI Phytozome for plants.\nIn many cases, these databases don’t contain the exact same reference genome files than NCBI. Often, at least the annotation is different, but even the assembly may have small differences including in chromosome/scaffold names, which can make these files completely incompatible. And to make matters even more complicated, it is not always clear which database is the best source for your genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 The genome assembly FASTA file\n\nThe FASTA format\nFASTA files contain one or more DNA or amino acid sequences, with no limits on the number of sequences or the sequence lengths. FASTA is a ubiquitous format in genetics and genomics – it is the standard format for, e.g.:\n\nGenome assembly sequences\nTranscriptomes and proteomes (all of an organism’s transcripts & amino acid sequences, respectively)\nSequence downloads from NCBI such as a single gene/protein or other GenBank entry\n\nThe following example FASTA file contains two entries:\n&gt;unique_sequence_ID Optional description\nATTCATTAAAGCAGTTTATTGGCTTAATGTACATCAGTGAAATCATAAATGCTAAAAA\n&gt;unique_sequence_ID2\nATTCATTAAAGCAGTTTATTGGCTTAATGTACATCAGTGAAATCATAAATGCTAAATG\nEach FASTA entry consists of:\n\nA header line that starts with a &gt; (greater-than sign) and provides an identifier and optionally additional information about the sequence.3\nA nucleotide or amino acid sequence (which can take 1 or several/many lines)\n\n\n\nThe Culex genome assembly FASTA file\nThe Culex reference genome files are in the data/ref directory:\nls -lh data/ref\n-rw------- 1 jelmer PAS0471 547M Jan 22 12:34 GCF_016801865.2.fna\n-rw------- 1 jelmer PAS0471 123M Jan 22 12:34 GCF_016801865.2.gtf\nThe FASTA file is GCF_016801865.2.fna and is quite large (547 Mb).\nWhile you can easily open small to medium-size files in the editor pane, this doesn’t work well for larger files like these. A handy command to view text files of any size is less, which opens them up in a “pager” within your shell – you’ll see what that means if you try it with one of the assembly FASTA file:\nless data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.fna\n&gt;NC_068937.1 Culex pipiens pallens isolate TS chromosome 1, TS_CPP_V2, whole genome shotgun sequence\naagcccttttatggtcaaaaatatcgtttaacttgaatatttttccttaaaaaataaataaatttaagcaaacagctgag\ntagatgtcatctactcaaatctacccataagcacacccctgttcaatttttttttcagccataagggcgcctccagtcaa\nattttcatattgagaatttcaatacaattttttaagtcgtaggggcgcctccagtcaaattttcatattgagaatttcaa\ntacatttttttatgtcgtaggggcgcctccagtcaaattttcatattgagaatttcaatacattttttttaagtcgtagg\nggcgcctccagtcaaattttcatattgagaatttcaatacatttttttaagtcttaggggcgcctccagtcaaattttca\ntattgagaatttcaatacatttttttaagtcgtaggggcgcctccagtcaaattttcatattgagaattttaatacaatt\nttttaaatcctaggggcgccttcagacaaacttaatttaaaaaatatcgctcctcgacttggcgactttgcgactgactg\ncgacagcactaccttggaacactgaaatgtttggttgactttccagaaagagtgcatatgacttgaaaaaaaaagagcgc\nttcaaaattgagtcaagaaattggtgaaacttggtgcaagcccttttatggttaaaaatatcgtttaacttgaatatttt\ntccttaaaaaataaataaatttaagcaaacagctgagtagatgtcatctactcaaatctacccataagcacacccctgga\nCCTAATTCATGGAGGTGAATAGAGCATACGTAAATACAAAACTCATGACATTAGCCTGTAAGGATTGTGTaattaatgca\naaaatattgaTAGAATGAAAGATGCAAGTCccaaaaattttaagtaaatgaATAGTAATCATAAAGATAActgatgatga\n\n\n Exercise: Explore the file with less\nAfter running the above command, the file should have “opened” inside the less pager.\nYou can move around in the file in several ways: by scrolling with your mouse, with up and down arrows, or, if you have them, PgUp and PgDn keys (also, u will move up half a page and d will move down half a page).\nNotice that you are “inside” this pager and won’t have your shell prompt back until you press q to quit less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: Lowercase vs. uppercase nucleotide letters (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you have probably noticed, nucleotide bases are typically typed in uppercase (A, C, G, T). What does the mixture of lowercase and uppercase bases in the Cx. pipiens assembly FASTA mean, then?\nLowercase bases are “soft-masked”: they are repetitive sequences, and bioinformatics programs can treat them differently than non-repetitive sequences, which are in uppercase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: Several file extensions are used for FASTA files (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may see files with any of the following file extensions: .fa, .fasta, .fna, .faa\nOf these, “generic” extensions are .fasta and .fa (e.g: culex_assembly.fasta)\nWhile the other extensions explicitly indicate whether sequences are nucleotides (.fna) or amino acids (.faa)\n\nThese extensions are mainly used to help users quickly identify the sequence type: the underlying format is the same in all cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Annotation files\nAs you saw, the genome assembly FASTA file merely contains the sequences of the chromosomes/scaffolds. How do you know where the genes are located on these sequences? That’s where the annotation file comes in, which in this case is a GTF file (GCF_016801865.2.gtf).\nWe won’t explore the GTF annotation file, but it is basically a large table with information about the positions of genes and other genomic features. This is the basic idea (the actual format isn’t quite as simple as this – see the Appendix for more):\nchromosome      feature  start  end   strand\n--------------------------------------------\nchromosome1     gene1    17     1356   +\nchromosome1     gene2    4902   5041   +"

    "text": "4 FASTQ files\n\n4.1 The FASTQ format\nFASTQ is the standard HTS read data file format. Just like FASTA files, they contain sequences, but unlike in FASTA files, the sequences in FASTQ files are accomponiedied by quality scores (hence FASTQ as in “Q” for “quality”).\nEach read is represented by four lines::\n\nA header that starts with @ and e.g. uniquely identifies the read\nThe sequence itself\nA plus sign, +\nOne-character quality scores for each base\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FASTQ format.\n\n\nEach qualiy score character corresponds to a numeric “Phred” quality score (\\(Q\\)) that is a function of the estimated error probability for a base call (\\(P\\)):\n\\[\nQ = -10 * log_{10}(P)\n\\]\nSome specific probabilities and their rough qualitative interpretation for Illumina data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhred quality score\nError probability\nRough interpretation\nASCII in FASTQ\n\n\n\n\n10\n1 in 10\nterrible\n+\n\n\n20\n1 in 100\nbad\n5\n\n\n30\n1 in 1,000\ngood\n?\n\n\n40\n1 in 10,000\nexcellent\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n But why use those ASCII characters in the quality line? (Click to see the solution)\n\nTo be clear, the numeric Phred quality score is represented in FASTQ files by a “ASCII character” corresponding to the number rather than the number itself. So why is this?\nThis allows for a single-character representation of each possible score — such that each quality score character can conveniently correspond to (& line up with) a base character in the read.\nFor your reference, here is a complete lookup table – look at the top table, BASE=33).\n\n\n\n4.2 Listing the FASTQ files\nLet’s take another look at your list of FASTQ files:\nls -lh data/fastq\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 21M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 22M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802863_R2.fastq.gz\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 21M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802864_R1.fastq.gz\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 22M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802864_R2.fastq.gz\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 22M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802865_R1.fastq.gz\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 22M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802865_R2.fastq.gz\n[...truncated...]\nIn the file listing above:\n\nFirst, take note of the file sizes. They are “only” about 22 Mb in size, and all have a very similar size. This is because I “subsampled” the FASTQ files to only retain 500,000 reads per file. The original files were on average over 1 Gb in size with about 30 million reads.\nSecond, if you look closely at the file names, it looks like there are two FASTQ files per sample: one with _R1 at the end of the file name, and one with _R2.\n\n\n\n What might each of the two files per sample represent/contain? )Click for the solution)\n\nThese contain the forward reads (_R1.fastq.gz) vs. the reverse reads (_R2.fastq.gz).\n\n\n\n Do you have any idea why the file extension ends in .gz? (Click for the solution)\n\nThis means the file is compressed, specifically with a program called “gzip”. This saves a lot of space: compressed files can be up to 10 times smaller than uncompressed files. Most bioinformatics tools, including the FastQC program we’ll run in a bit, can work with gzipped files directly, so there is no need to decompress them.\n\n\n\n4.3 Viewing FASTQ files\nDespite the file compression, you can simply use the less command as before to view the FASTQ files:\nless data/fastq/ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz\n@ERR10802863.8435456 8435456 length=74\nCAACGAATACATCATGTTTGCGAAACTACTCCTCCTCGCCTTGGTGGGGATCAGTACTGCGTACCAGTATGAGT\n+\nAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n@ERR10802863.27637245 27637245 length=74\nGCCACACTTTTGAAGAACAGCGTCATTGTTCTTAATTTTGTCGGCAACGCCTGCACGAGCCTTCCACGTAAGTT\n+\nAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAEE&lt;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\n Exercise: Spotting problematic reads\nExplore the FASTQ file a bit inside less. Can you spot any unusual-looking reads? How do you interpret this?\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\nThe 5th read looks as follows — and if you scroll down you should quickly see several more reads just like this:\n@ERR10802863.11918285 11918285 length=35\nNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN\n+\n###################################\nThese only consist of N bases (and they are also shorter than the other reads), and are therefore completely useless!\n(Note that it is generally not common to run into these kinds of failed reads as easily!)\n\n\n\nWhile the above problematic reads were easy to spot, we typically don’t perform extensive quality control by manually inspecting FASTQ files. There are simply too many reads to make sense of! Instead, you can use specialized tools like FastQC to summarize FASTQ files – that’s what we’ll do now."

    "text": "5 FastQC for quality control of HTS reads\nFastQC is a very useful and widely used tool to perform quality control of HTS reads. It is also a good first example of a bioinformatics tool with a command-line interface.\n\n5.1 Running FastQC\nTo run FastQC, use the command fastqc. To analyze a FASTQ files with default FastQC settings, a complete FastQC command would simply be fastqc, followed by the name of the file as the argument:\nfastqc data/fastq/ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz\nbash: fastqc: command not found...\n\nLoading the FastQC “module”\nBut of course, it can’t be quite that simple – we get an error! While FastQC is installed at OSC4, we have to “load it” before we can use it. The finer details of using software at OSC are outside of the scope of this lab, but please accept that we can load FastQC as follows:\nmodule load fastqc/0.12.1\n\n\nChanging the output dir\nWe’re also going to make a chance to our command. An annoying default behavior of FastQC is that it writes output files in the dir where the input files are – it’s not good practice to directly mix data and results like that!\nTo figure out how we can change that behavior, note that many commands and bioinformatics tools alike have an option -h and/or --help to print usage information to the screen.\n\n\n Exercise: Finding the output directory option\nPrint FastQC’s help info, and figure out which option you can use to specify an output dir of your choice.\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\nfastqc -h and fastqc --help will both work to show the help info.\nYou’ll get quite a bit of output printed to screen, including the snippet about output directories that is reproduced below:\nfastqc -h\n  -o --outdir  Create all output files in the specified output directory.\n               Please note that this directory must exist as the program\n               will not create it.  If this option is not set then the \n               output file for each sequence file is created in the same\n               directory as the sequence file which was processed.\nSo, you can use -o or equivalently, --outdir to specify an output dir.\n\n\n\nYou’ll want to put the output in the directory you created in the first part of the lab, e.g. for me it would be jelmer/fastqc:\n# Replace 'jelmer' with your own dir name \nfastqc --outdir jelmer/fastqc data/fastq/ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz\nSpecified output directory 'jelmer/fastqc' does not exist\n\n Exercise: Fixing the output directory problem\n😡 What is going on this time? Can you try to fix the problem?\n\n\nIf you know what the problem is, click here for a hint on how to fix it\n\nYou can create a new directory either by using the buttons in the VS Code side bar or with the mkdir command – here, try it as mkdir -p followed by the name (path) of the directory you want to create:\nmkdir -p REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-DESIRED-OUTPUT-DIR\n\n\n\nClick here for the solution\n\n\nThe problem, as the error message indicates, is that the output directory that we specified with --outdir does not exist.

    "text": "6 Interpreting FastQC’s output\nFirst, you’ll have to download FastQC’s output HTML files, because with your current setup, you unfortunately can’t view HTML files within VS Code at OSC:\n\nFind the FastQC HTML files in the file explorer in the VS Code side bar.\nRight-click on one of them, click Download... and follow the prompt to download the file somewhere to your computer (doesn’t matter where, just make sure you see where it goes).\nRepeat this for the second file\nThen, open your computer’s file browser, find the downloaded files, and double-click on one. It should be opened in your default web browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you right-clock on a file or folder in the VS Code file browser, there’s a button to Download it.\n\n\nWe’ll now go through a couple of the FastQC plots/modules, with first some example plots5 with good/bad results for reference.\n\nOverview of module results\nFastQC has “pass” (checkmark in green), “warning” (exclamation mark in orange), and “fail” (cross in red) assessments for each module, as you can see below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about the FastQC module assessments (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese pass/warning/fail assessments are handy and typically at least somewhat meaningful, but you should realize that a “warning” or a “fail” is not necessarily the bad news that it may appear to be. That’s because, for example:\n\nSome of these modules are rather strict, perhaps overly strict.\nSome warnings and fails are easily remedied or simply not a very big deal.\nFastQC assumes that your data is derived from whole-genome shotgun sequencing — some other types of data like RNA-Seq data will always trigger a couple of warnings and files based on expected differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic statistics\nThis section shows, for example, the number of sequences (reads) and the read length range for your file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer base quality sequence quality\nThis figure visualize the mean per-base Phred quality score (as discussed above; y-axis) along the length of the reads (x-axis). Note that:\n\nA decrease in sequence quality along the reads is normal\nR2 (reverse) reads are usually worse than R1 (forward) reads\n\n\n\nGood / acceptable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBad:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdapter content\nChecks for known adapter sequences. As you’ve learned, when an insert size is shorter than the read length, adapters will end up in the sequence – these should be removed!\n\n\nGood:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBad:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise: Interpreting the FastQC output\nOpen the HTML file for the R1 FASTQ file and go through the modules we discussed above. Can you make sense of it? Does the data look good to you, overall?\nNow open the HTML file for the R2 FASTQ file and take a look just at the quality score graph. Does it look any worse than the R1?"

Because it is free, open-source, cross-platform, and works with code rather than a graphical user interface (GUI), it is likely the best choice for reproducible data analysis all around.\n\n\n2.2 R vs. RStudio\nTo run R, all you need is the R program. However, we will be running R inside a fancy editor called RStudio, which makes working with R much more pleasant!\nSimilar to VS Code, you can run a version of RStudio within your browser by starting an Interactive App through OSC OnDemand."

    "text": "5 R basics\n\n5.1 R as calculator\nTo get some familiarity with working in R, you will start by simply using R as calculator. Type 5 + 5 in the console and press Enter:\n\n5 + 5\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nR will print the result of the calculation, 10. The result is prefaced by [1], which is simply an index/count of output items – this can be helpful when many items are printed.\nA couple more examples:\n\n# Multiplication\n6 * 8\n\n[1] 48\n\n# Division\n40 / 5\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code will work with (like shown above) or without spaces between numbers and around operators like +. However, it is good practice to leave space between the number to improve the readability of your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 The R prompt\nThe &gt; sign in your console is the R prompt, indicating that that R is ready for you to type something. In other words, this is equivalent to the $ Shell prompt you’ve seen in the week 3 lab.\nAlso just like in Unix shell, when you are not seeing the prompt, R is either busy (because you asked it to do a longer-running computation) or waiting for you to complete an incomplete command.\nIf you notice that your prompt turned into a +, you typed an incomplete command – for example:\n\n10 /\n\n+\nYou can either try to finish the command or abort it by pressing Ctrl+C or Esc – go ahead and practice the latter now to get your prompt back after the above command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding comments to your code\n\n\n\nComments in R are also just like in the Unix shell: you can use # signs to comment your code, both inline and on separate lines:\n\n# This line is entirely ignored by R\n10 / 5  # This line contains code but everything after the '#' is ignored\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Comparing things\nIn R, you can use comparison operators to compare numbers. When you do this, R will return either FALSE or TRUE (the so-called logical data type). For example:\n\nGreater than and less than:\n\n8 &gt; 3\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n2 &lt; 1\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nEqual to or not equal to – note that you need to use two equals signs == for the former:\n\n7 == 7\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# The exclamation mark in general is a \"negator\"\n10 != 5\n\n[1] TRUE"

    "section": "6 Functions in R",
    "text": "6 Functions in R\nTo do almost anything in R, you will use “functions”, which are the equivalent of Unix commands. R has over 3,000 functions that serve many different purposes.\n\n6.1 Basics of functions\nYou can recognize function calls by the parentheses. For example:\n\nThe equivalent to the Shell’s pwd is getwd() for “get working dir”:\n\n# You will see a different output depending on your working directory\ngetwd()\n\n/users/PAS2880/jelmer\nInside those parentheses, you can provide arguments to a function. For example, using setwd(), the equivalent to the Shell’s cd, to set your working dir, the argument is the file path to set as working dir:\n\nsetwd(\"/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that unlike in the Shell, you need to quote (\"..\") the file path! This is because in R, anything non-numeric that is not quoted is supposed to be a pre-existing “object” – more on those in a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Function arguments\nConsider the example below, where you pass the argument 6.53 to the function round():\n\nround(6.53)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nIn most functions, including round(), arguments have names that can be used. For example, the argument to round() represents the number to be rounded has the name x, so you can also use:\n\nround(x = 6.53)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nNaming arguments is helpful in particular to avoid confusion when you pass multiple arguments to a function. For example, round() accepts a second argument, which is the number of digits to round to:\n\nround(x = 6.53, digits = 1)\n\n[1] 6.5\n\n\nYou could choose not to name these arguments, but that is not as easy to understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can usually see which arguments a function takes by pausing after your type the function and its parenthesis, e.g. round():\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, you’ll also learn about ways to get more extensive help information about a function."

This is a one-time operation – you won’t need to reinstall a package when you start a new R session later.\nThe function library() will load an R package in your current R session. Every time you want to use a package in R, you need to load it, just like everytime you want to use MS Word on your computer, you need to open it.\n\nTo practice with this, you will now install several packages you’ll need in next week’s lab.

    "text": "13 A brief intro to the tidyverse and pipes\nFinally, you’ll learn a little about a versatily family of R packages designed for data science called the “tidyverse”. The tidyverse is quite large and includes the famous ggplot2 package to create all sorts of data visualizations – we’ll barely scratch the surface here but this should already give you some useful tools.\n\n13.1 read_tsv() to read tabular data\nThe read_tsv() function reads a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file into a dataframe, taking the path to the file as its main argument – here, read the sample metadata file used in next week’s lab:\n\nmeta &lt;- read_tsv(\"/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/data/meta/metadata.tsv\")\n\n\n\nRows: 22 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \"\\t\"\nchr (3): sample_id, time, treatment\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nTake a look at the resulting data frame meta:\n\nmeta\n\n# A tibble: 22 × 3\n   sample_id   time  treatment  \n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1 ERR10802882 10d   cathemerium\n 2 ERR10802875 10d   cathemerium\n 3 ERR10802879 10d   cathemerium\n 4 ERR10802883 10d   cathemerium\n 5 ERR10802878 10d   control    \n 6 ERR10802884 10d   control    \n 7 ERR10802877 10d   control    \n 8 ERR10802881 10d   control    \n 9 ERR10802876 10d   relictum   \n10 ERR10802880 10d   relictum   \n# ℹ 12 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibble??\n\n\n\nThe output above is a so-called “tibble”, as the top of the output above mentions. This is a modern take on data frames provided by the tidyverse. Tibbles behave mostly like data frames, but have some nice features mostly in the way they are printed to screen.\n\n\n\n\n13.2 select() to pick columns\nselect() subsets a data frame by including/excluding certain columns. By default, it only includes the columns you specify:\n\nselect(.data = meta, sample_id, treatment)\n\n# A tibble: 22 × 2\n   sample_id   treatment  \n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1 ERR10802882 cathemerium\n 2 ERR10802875 cathemerium\n 3 ERR10802879 cathemerium\n 4 ERR10802883 cathemerium\n 5 ERR10802878 control    \n 6 ERR10802884 control    \n 7 ERR10802877 control    \n 8 ERR10802881 control    \n 9 ERR10802876 relictum   \n10 ERR10802880 relictum   \n# ℹ 12 more rows\n\n\nAbove, the first argument was the data frame, whereas the other arguments were the (unquoted!) names of columns to be kept.\nThe output is a new, modified dataframe (same for the following functions), which in the example above, you simply printed to the screen – but as you’ll see later, you can store the output too.\n\n\n13.3 filter() to pick rows (observations)\nThe filter() function outputs only those rows that satisfy one or more conditions. It is similar to Filter functionality in Excel. For example, to only keep rows for the 10d timepoint:\n\nfilter(.data = meta, time == \"10d\")\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 3\n   sample_id   time  treatment  \n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1 ERR10802882 10d   cathemerium\n 2 ERR10802875 10d   cathemerium\n 3 ERR10802879 10d   cathemerium\n 4 ERR10802883 10d   cathemerium\n 5 ERR10802878 10d   control    \n 6 ERR10802884 10d   control    \n 7 ERR10802877 10d   control    \n 8 ERR10802881 10d   control    \n 9 ERR10802876 10d   relictum   \n10 ERR10802880 10d   relictum   \n11 ERR10802885 10d   relictum   \n12 ERR10802886 10d   relictum   \n\n\n\n\n13.4 The pipe (|&gt;)\nIt’s common to want to use several consecutive functions to wrangle a dataframe into the format you want. For example, you may want to first select() one or more columns, then filter() the resulting dataframe. You could do that as follows:\n\nmeta_sel &lt;- select(.data = meta, sample_id, time)\nfilter(.data = meta_sel, time == \"10d\")\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n   sample_id   time \n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 ERR10802882 10d  \n 2 ERR10802875 10d  \n 3 ERR10802879 10d  \n 4 ERR10802883 10d  \n 5 ERR10802878 10d  \n 6 ERR10802884 10d  \n 7 ERR10802877 10d  \n 8 ERR10802881 10d  \n 9 ERR10802876 10d  \n10 ERR10802880 10d  \n11 ERR10802885 10d  \n12 ERR10802886 10d  \n\n\nYou could go on along these lines, successively creating new objects that you then use for the next step. But there is a more elegant way of dong this, directly sending (“piping”) output from one function into the next function with the pipe operator |&gt; (a vertical bar | followed by a greater-than sign &gt;).\nLet’s start by seeing a reformulation of the code above with pipes:\n\nmeta |&gt;\n  select(sample_id, time) |&gt;\n  filter(time == \"10d\")\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n   sample_id   time \n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 ERR10802882 10d  \n 2 ERR10802875 10d  \n 3 ERR10802879 10d  \n 4 ERR10802883 10d  \n 5 ERR10802878 10d  \n 6 ERR10802884 10d  \n 7 ERR10802877 10d  \n 8 ERR10802881 10d  \n 9 ERR10802876 10d  \n10 ERR10802880 10d  \n11 ERR10802885 10d  \n12 ERR10802886 10d  \n\n\nWhat happened here? You took the meta data frame, sent (“piped”) it into the select() function, whose output in turn was piped into the filter() function.\nYou can think of the pipe as “then”: take meta, then select, then rename.\nWhen using the pipe, you no longer specify the input with the .data argument, because the function now gets its input data via the pipe. Using pipes involves less typing and is more readable than successive assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor code readability, it is good practice to start a new line after a pipe |&gt;, and to keep the subsequent line(s) indented as RStudio will automatically do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional: Using the pipe keyboard shortcut (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following RStudio keyboard shortcut will insert a pipe symbol: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M.\nHowever, by default this (still) inserts an older pipe symbol, %&gt;%. To make RStudio insert the |&gt; pipe symbol with this keyboard shortcut:\n\nClick Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Code tab on the right\nCheck the box “Use native pipe operator” as shown below\nClick OK at the bottom of the options dialog box to apply the change and close the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise: Tidyverse functions and pipes\nUse a “pipeline” like above to output a data frame with two columns (sample_id and treatment) only for the cathemerium treatment. How many rows does your output data frame have?\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\n\nmeta |&gt;\n  select(sample_id, treatment) |&gt;\n  filter(treatment == \"cathemerium\")\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  sample_id   treatment  \n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;      \n1 ERR10802882 cathemerium\n2 ERR10802875 cathemerium\n3 ERR10802879 cathemerium\n4 ERR10802883 cathemerium\n5 ERR10802864 cathemerium\n6 ERR10802867 cathemerium\n7 ERR10802870 cathemerium\n\n\nThe output data frame has 7 rows and 2 columns: note that “7 x 2” is helpfully shown at the top of the output in the console."

    "text": "2 Computational infrastructure overview\nDue in large part to the amount of data involved, a laptop or desktop computer is often not sufficient to work with HTS data. Additionally, most of the specialized programs that help you analyze your data can only be run through a “command-line interface”, in which you type commands rather than point-and-click.\nFor these reasons, a typical computational infrastructure -the computer hardware and software- to do genomics analyses involves:\n\nA supercomputer1 – in our case, the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)\nA text editor – in our case, VS Code\nThe Unix shell (terminal) and command-line programs that run in it\nR (or perhaps Python) for statistical analysis and visualization.\n\nToday, you will see the first three of these components in action. In this first part, you’ll get a little familiar with them, and in the next part, you’ll apply what you learned to reference genome and HTS read data. (In next week’s lab, we will cover the fourth item in the context of RNA-Seq differential expression analysis.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: “I don’t think I like coding. Can I avoid all of this?” (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you will often be doing HTS/genomics projects like the ones mentioned above, it’s hard to avoid using this (kind of) infrastructure. But especially if you’re only doing a single project like this, you might avoid it by:\n\nOutsourcing part of the analysis: companies or service cores can often do the more standardized, compute-heavy parts for you\nTrying a platform like Galaxy, which has a web browser interface and doesn’t require coding\n\nFinally, generative AI tools are becoming increasingly capable of writing code for you based on your instructions, and may spurn additional no-code or low-code solutions in the future."

    "text": "3 The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)\n\n3.1 Introduction to supercomputers\nA supercomputer (also known as a “cluster”) consists of many computers that are connected by a high-speed network, and can be accessed remotely by its users. You can think of it simply as a network of computers — with individual computers called “nodes”.\nSupercomputers provide two main types of resources:\n\nCompute: computing power to run your data processing and analysis\nFile storage: space for storage of your data and results\n\nWhy might you need a supercomputer?\n\nOften, your HTS dataset is too large to be handled efficiently, or at all, by a laptop/desktop computer\nTo speed up analyses by using more computing power and/or running them in parallel\nIt’s also a great place to store large amounts of data — and genomics data is often very large\n\n\n\n3.2 Introduction to OSC\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) provides computing resources to researchers and others across Ohio. Research usage is charged at subsidized rates, and in our case at CFAES, these costs are absorbed at the college level.\nThis is what “Cardinal”, one of the OSC supercomputers, physically looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cardinal OSC cluster: it’s just some cabinets with many connected computers inside!\n\n\n\nThe structure of an OSC supercomputer\nYou can think of a supercomputer as having three main parts:\n\nLogin Nodes: The handful of computers users end up on after logging in\nCompute Nodes: The many computers you can reserve to run your analyses\nFile Systems: Where files are stored (these are shared between the OSC clusters)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of a supercomputer with three main components: file systems, login nodes, and compute nodes\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 The OSC OnDemand web portal\n Go to https://ondemand.osc.edu and use the username + password login option on the left-hand side to log in with your OSC (not OSU!) credentials.\nOnce logged in, you should see a landing page similar to the one below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe OSC OnDemand landing page\n\n\nWe will now go through some of the dropdown menus in the blue bar along the top.\n\nFiles menu\nHovering over the Files dropdown menu gives a list of folders you have access to. If your account is brand new, you should only see three listed:\n\nA Home folder for miscellaneous personal files (starts with /users/)\nThe PAS2880 project’s “project” folder for permanent storage (/fs/ess/PAS2880)\nThe PAS2880 project’s “scratch” folder for temporary storage (/fs/scratch/PAS2880)\n\n Click on the PAS2880 scratch folder, /fs/scratch/PAS2880. You should see the folders and files present there, and click on folders to explore their contents. Click on the ENT6703 folder, which we’ll be using for these labs, and you should see the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe OnDemand file browser\n\n\nThis interface is much like the file browser on your own computer, so you can create, delete, move, copy files and folders. Additionally, you can upload (from your computer to OSC) and download (from OSC your computer) files – see the buttons across the top.\n Create your own folder by clicking the New Directory button at the top. Give it the exact same name as your OSC username, including any capitalization. (I’ll refer to this folder as your personal folder from now on.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf in doubt, you can see what your username is by looking at the right side of the blue top bar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise: Understanding file/folder locations\n\nClick on your personal folder to enter it.\nTake a look at the so-called “path” (file/folder location) shown at the top of the file browser, next to “Change directory”. How do you interpret this notation: what do the forward slashes / indicate, and what does each part in between represent? You can click back-and-forth to see how the path changes.\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\nThe forward slashes / separate folder in a path. Each part in between represents a folder name. For example, in /fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703:\n\n/fs is a top-level folder – you can always distinguish a top-level folder because the path starts with a forward slash /\ninside that is the scratch folder\ninside that is the PAS2880 folder\ninside that is the ENT6703 folder\n\nTaking a step back, the OSC file system is a single hierarchical structure. File systems on personal computers are structured very similarly, though in Windows, among some other differences, backslashes &lt;/kbd&gt; are used instead of forward slashes /.\n\n\n\nClick to see a diagram of the OSC file system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf user miranda made a folder inside the ENT6703 folder, what would be the path to that folder?\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\nThe path would be /fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/miranda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: OSC System Status overview(click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the “Clusters” dropdown menu, click on the item at the bottom, “System Status”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Clusters dropdown menu\n\n\nThis page shows an overview of the live, current usage of the two clusters – just to give you an idea of the scale of the supercomputer center and its usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the “System Status” page showing live cluster usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Apps\nYou can access a bunch of software via the Interactive Apps dropdown menu – go ahead and click on the “Code Server” button – that will allow us to use the VS Code text editor on OSC, as explained below."

In these labs:\n\nVS Code will be our editor for Unix shell code (this week)\nRStudio will be our editor for R (next week’s lab)\n\n\n\n4.2 Starting a VS Code session\nInteractive Apps like VS Code and RStudio run on compute nodes (not login nodes). Because compute nodes always need to be “reserved” to be used, you have to fill out a form and specify the following details:\n\nThe Cluster we want to use: pitzer\nThe Account, the OSC Project to be billed for the compute node usage: PAS2880\nThe Number of hours we want to make a reservation for: 4\nThe Working Directory (starting point) for the program: /fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703\nThe App Code Server version: 4.8.3 (this should be the only available option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is how you should fill out the form to start a VS Code session\n\n\nClick Launch and you’ll be sent to the My Interactive Sessions page with a card for your job at the top. First, your job may be Queued for some seconds (i.e., waiting for computing resources to be assigned to it), but it should soon switch to Starting and then to Running:\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the blue Connect to VS Code button appears, click that and VS Code will open in a new browser tab.

    "section": "5 The Unix shell",
    "text": "5 The Unix shell\n\n5.1 What is the Unix shell and why use it?\nA computer’s shell is an interface inside a Terminal window that allows you to interact with your computer by typing commands. More specifically, the Unix shell is the shell of Unix-based operating systems, which include Mac and Linux (but not Windows). Supercomputers like OSC run on Linux, so the default shell here -and for scientific computing in general- is a Unix shell.\nUsing the Unix shell is often a necessity when working with HTS data, in order to run the specialized software needed for data processing. But there are other good reasons to use the shell, including:\n\nAutomation and efficiency\nThe shell allows you to repeat and automate tasks easily and without introducing errors.\nReproducibility\nWhen working in the shell, it’s straightforward to keep a detailed record of what you have done.\nViewing and processing large files\nShell commands are excellent at viewing and processing large, plain-text files, which are common in omics data.\n\n\n\n5.2 First steps in the Unix shell\n\nThe shell prompt\nInside your terminal, the “prompt” indicates that the shell is ready for a command. Your prompt at OSC should show the following pieces of information:\n[&lt;username&gt;@&lt;node-name&gt; &lt;current-folder&gt;]$\nFor example, below, user jelmer is on node p0080 in folder ENT6703:\n[jelmer@p0080 ENT6703]$ \nYou type commands after the dollar sign $, and then press Enter to execute them. When it has finished executing, you’ll get your prompt back and can type a new command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow shell code is shown on this website\n\n\n\n\nThe pale gray boxes like the ones shown above are used to show the commands you should type.\nFrom now on, the prompt itself ([...]$) won’t be shown, only the commands you type. This saves space and allows you to copy-paste code from the boxes (but I recommend typing!).\nDarker gray boxes (with italic text, below the boxes with commands) show the output of commands.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few simple commands: date, whoami, pwd\nThe Unix shell comes with hundreds of “commands”: small programs that perform specific actions. (If you’re familiar with R or Python, a Unix command is like an R/Python function.) Let’s start with a few simple commands:\n\nThe date command prints the current date and time:\ndate\nFri Jan 26 14:31:51 EST 2024\nThe whoami (who-am-i) command prints your username:\nwhoami\njelmer\nThe pwd -Print Working Directory- command prints the “path” (location) of the folder you are currently located in:\npwd\n/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/jelmer\n\nAll those commands provided us with some output. That output was printed to screen, which is the default behavior for nearly every Unix command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome terminology\n\n\n\n\nRecall that “directory” / “dir” is just a synonym for “folder” – we’ll use “dir” from now on\nWhen working in a Unix shell, you are always “in” a specific directory, which is called your working dir\nRecall from earlier that a “path”, such as that output by pwd, specifies the location of a file or dir in a computer’s file system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 cd and command actions & arguments\nIn the above three examples:\n\nYou merely typed a command and nothing else\nThe command provided some information, which was printed to screen\n\nBut many commands perform an action other than providing information. For example, you can use the command cd to Change Directory, i.e. change your working dir.\nLet’s use cd to move to another dir by specifying the path to that directory after the cd command:\ncd /fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/share\nNote that cd had no output at all. But it did perform the desired action, which we can see by checking the working directory again with pwd:\npwd\n/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/share\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will demonstrate a neat feature called “tab completion”!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn more abstract terms, you provided cd with an argument above, namely the path of the dir to move to. Arguments generally tell commands what file or directory to operate on.\nSo, cd gives no output when it succesfully changed the working directory. But let’s also see what happens when it does not succeed — it gives an error:\ncd /fs/Scratch/PAS2880\nbash: cd: /fs/Scratch/PAS2880: No such file or directory\n\n\n What was the problem with the path we specified? (Click to see the answer)\n\nWe used a capital S in /Scratch/ — this should have been /scratch/.\nEverything in the shell is case-sensitive, including commands and file names. So if a directory is called scratch, typing Scratch will not work!\n\n\n\n5.4 ls and command options\n\nThe default behavior of ls\nThe ls command, short for “list”, will list files and directories – by default those present in your current working dir:\nls\ndata  README.md\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: ls output colors (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ls output shown above does not show the different colors you should see in your shell, where:\n\nEntries in blue are directories (like data and metadata above)\nEntries in black are regular files (like README.md above)\nEntries in red are compressed files (we’ll see an example soon).\n\n(Though colors may vary depending on your terminal and color scheme settings.)\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions (to ls)\nThe way that ls shows the output can be changed using options. In general, while arguments tell a command what to operate on, options will modify its behavior. For example, we can call ls with the option -l (a dash followed by a lowercase L):\nls -l \ntotal 17\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 jelmer PAS0471 4096 Jan 21 12:39 data\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 1502 Jan 22 11:04 README.md\nNotice that it lists the same items as our first ls call above, but printed in a different format: one item per line, with additional information such as the last-modified date and time, and the file sizes in bytes (to the left of the date).\nLet’s add another option, -h:\nls -l -h\ntotal 17K\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 jelmer PAS0471 4.0K Jan 21 12:39 data\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 1.5K Jan 22 11:04 README.md\n\n\n What is different about the output, and what do you think that means? (Click to see the answer)\n\nThe only difference is in the format of the column reporting the sizes of the items listed.\nYou now have “Human-readable filesizes” (hence -h), where sizes on the scale of kilobytes will be shown with Ks, of megabytes with Ms, and of gigabytes with Gs. Minor detail, but this can be quite useful especially for large files.\n\nConveniently, options can be “pasted together”; ls -lh is equivalent to ls -l -h:\nls -lh\ntotal 17K\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 jelmer PAS0471 4.0K Jan 21 12:39 data\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 1.5K Jan 22 11:04 README.md\n\n\nCombining options and arguments\nArguments to ls should be dirs or files to operate on. For example, if you wanted to see what’s inside the data dir, instead of inside your working dir, we could type:\nls data\nfastq  meta  ref\nThe data dir appears to contain three dirs with different kinds of data. We’ll talk in detail about that later, but for now, take a look inside the fastq dir:\nls data/fastq\nERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802865_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802868_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802870_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802875_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802877_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802880_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802882_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802885_R1.fastq.gz\nERR10802863_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802866_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802868_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802871_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802875_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802878_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802880_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802883_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802885_R2.fastq.gz\nERR10802864_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802866_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802869_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802871_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802876_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802878_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802881_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802883_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802886_R1.fastq.gz\nERR10802864_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802867_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802869_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802874_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802876_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802879_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802881_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802884_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802886_R2.fastq.gz\nERR10802865_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802867_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802870_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802874_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802877_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802879_R2.fastq.gz  ERR10802882_R1.fastq.gz  ERR10802884_R2.fastq.gz\nAh, FASTQ files!

Here, you used short ones like data and data/fastq. What is the difference between these kinds of paths?\n\nWhen you use cd, you have to use long paths, but with ls you can use short ones.\ndata and data/fastq are just shorter because they are closer to the root of the filesystem, so there are fewer dirs to travel through.\nThe long paths start from the root of the file system, while the short paths start from your current working dir.\nThe long paths are for directories, while the short paths are for files.\n\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\nThe correct answer is C.\nThe long paths are called absolute paths, and start from the root of the file system (recognized by a leading slash like in /fs/ess). Making an analogy with geographic locations, you can think of these as GPS coordinates: they always point to the same location, no matter where you currently are.\nThe short paths are relative paths, starting from your current working dir. So, if your working dir is /fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703, then data is equivalent to /fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/data. Continuing the geographic analogy, these are like giving directions starting from your current location such as “take the second left”.\n\n\n\n\n5.5 A few more general shell tips\n\nCommand history: If you hit the ⇧ (up arrow) once, you’ll retrieve your most recent command, and if you keep hitting it, you’ll go further back. The⇩ (down arrow) will go the other way: towards the present.\nYour cursor can be anywhere on a line (not just at the end) when you press Enter to execute a command!\nAnything that comes after a # is considered a comment instead of code!\n# This entire line is a comment - you can run it and nothing will happen\npwd    # 'pwd' will be executed but everything after the '#' is ignored\n/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/jelmer\n\n\n\n Exercise: Shell navigation practice\n\nMove into your personal directory (the one you created a little while back), and then back into the share dir.\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\n\nMove into your personal dir (replace jelmer with your username):\ncd /fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/jelmer\nMove back to ENT6703:\ncd /fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/share\n\n\nUse command history (arrows) to repeat the previous exercise without typing commands.\n\n\n\n Bonus Exercise: Advanced navigation\nIn the first question, did you perhaps find yourself wondering how you can move up a level in the file system? In a path, .. denotes one level up, so ../bla means one level up and then down into the bla directory.\nTry to make use of this construct to move into your personal dir and back to share again, instead of using the “full paths” like above. Hint: Tab completion after typing ../ can help you to orient yourself!\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\n\nInto your personal dir (replace jelmer with your own username):\ncd ../jelmer\nBack to share:\ncd ../share\n\n\n\n\nClick to see a diagram of using .."

    "text": "2 Getting set up\n\n2.1 Start an RStudio session at OSC\nStart an RStudio session at OSC like we did last week and like you did for this week’s homework:\n\nLog in to OSC at https://ondemand.osc.edu\nClick on Interactive Apps (top bar) and then RStudio Server (all the way at the bottom)\nFill out the form as follows:\n\nCluster: Pitzer\nR version: 4.4.0\nProject: PAS2880\nNumber of hours: 4\nNode type: any\nNumber of cores: 2\n\nClick the big blue Launch button at the bottom\nNow, you should be sent to a new page with a box at the top for your RStudio Server “job”, which should initially be “Queued” (waiting to start).\nYour job should start running very soon, with the top bar of the box turning green and saying “Running”.\nClick Connect to RStudio Server at the bottom of the box, and an RStudio Server instance will open in a new browser tab. You’re ready to go!\n\n\n\n2.2 Create an R script\nToday, you’re going to write most of your code in an R script instead of typing it directly in the R console, as explained in the R homework:\n\nCreate and open a new R script by clicking File (top menu bar) &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\nSave this new script right away by clicking File &gt; Save As. In the dialog box, you can save it right in the suggested folder (which is your OSC Home folder), or you can make a new folder for this course by clicking “New Folder” in the bottom left. Regardless, save the script as lab4_DE.R (the extension for R scripts is .R).\n\n\n\n2.3 Load the R packages you will use\nAs part of your homework, you installed a few R packages with functionality you’ll need in today’s lab.\nRecall that R packages behave equivalently to other software/apps, in that installation is a one-time thing, but you need to lead them in any given session to use them. Let’s start with that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, and with all the code in this lab, type or copy it in your script, and send it to the console from there. Recall that you can send code to the console by pressing Ctrl + Enter on Windows, or Cmd + Return on a Mac.\n\n\n\n\n# Then, load the R packages:\nlibrary(DESeq2)          # Differential expression analysis\nlibrary(EnhancedVolcano) # Volcano plot\nlibrary(tidyverse)       # Misc. data manipulation and plotting\n\nRunning the code above will produce output in the R console, and some of it in orange, but all should be good unless you see explicit errors at the bottom.\n\n\nClick to see expected output\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.1     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(DESeq2)\n\nLoading required package: S4Vectors\nLoading required package: stats4\nLoading required package: BiocGenerics\nLoading required package: generics\n\nAttaching package: 'generics'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:lubridate':\n\n    as.difftime\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    explain\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    as.difftime, as.factor, as.ordered, intersect, is.element, setdiff,\n    setequal, union\n\n\nAttaching package: 'BiocGenerics'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    combine\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    IQR, mad, sd, var, xtabs\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    anyDuplicated, aperm, append, as.data.frame, basename, cbind,\n    colnames, dirname, do.call, duplicated, eval, evalq, Filter, Find,\n    get, grep, grepl, is.unsorted, lapply, Map, mapply, match, mget,\n    order, paste, pmax, pmax.int, pmin, pmin.int, Position, rank,\n    rbind, Reduce, rownames, sapply, saveRDS, table, tapply, unique,\n    unsplit, which.max, which.min\n\n\nAttaching package: 'S4Vectors'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:lubridate':\n\n    second, second&lt;-\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    first, rename\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    expand\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:utils':\n\n    findMatches\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    expand.grid, I, unname\n\nLoading required package: IRanges\n\nAttaching package: 'IRanges'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:lubridate':\n\n    %within%\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    collapse, desc, slice\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    reduce\n\nLoading required package: GenomicRanges\nLoading required package: GenomeInfoDb\nLoading required package: SummarizedExperiment\nLoading required package: MatrixGenerics\nLoading required package: matrixStats\n\nAttaching package: 'matrixStats'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    count\n\n\nAttaching package: 'MatrixGenerics'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:matrixStats':\n\n    colAlls, colAnyNAs, colAnys, colAvgsPerRowSet, colCollapse,\n    colCounts, colCummaxs, colCummins, colCumprods, colCumsums,\n    colDiffs, colIQRDiffs, colIQRs, colLogSumExps, colMadDiffs,\n    colMads, colMaxs, colMeans2, colMedians, colMins, colOrderStats,\n    colProds, colQuantiles, colRanges, colRanks, colSdDiffs, colSds,\n    colSums2, colTabulates, colVarDiffs, colVars, colWeightedMads,\n    colWeightedMeans, colWeightedMedians, colWeightedSds,\n    colWeightedVars, rowAlls, rowAnyNAs, rowAnys, rowAvgsPerColSet,\n    rowCollapse, rowCounts, rowCummaxs, rowCummins, rowCumprods,\n    rowCumsums, rowDiffs, rowIQRDiffs, rowIQRs, rowLogSumExps,\n    rowMadDiffs, rowMads, rowMaxs, rowMeans2, rowMedians, rowMins,\n    rowOrderStats, rowProds, rowQuantiles, rowRanges, rowRanks,\n    rowSdDiffs, rowSds, rowSums2, rowTabulates, rowVarDiffs, rowVars,\n    rowWeightedMads, rowWeightedMeans, rowWeightedMedians,\n    rowWeightedSds, rowWeightedVars\n\nLoading required package: Biobase\nWelcome to Bioconductor\n\n    Vignettes contain introductory material; view with\n    'browseVignettes()'.

    "text": "3 Create a DESeq2 object\nLike in Garrigós et al. (2025), you’ll perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Differential Expression (DE) analysis. To do so, you’ll use the DESeq2 R package (Love, Huber, and Anders (2014), website).\nDESeq2 has its own “object type” (a specific R format type) and before you can do anything else, you need to create a DESeq2 object from three components:\n\nSample metadata\nThis table should contain information on which samples belong to which groups that should be compared (i.e., the experiment’s “independent variables”).\nCount table\nA table with one row per gene, and one column per sample.\nA statistical design\nA statistical design formula to tell DESEq2 which groups to compare\n\n\n3.1 Sample metadata\nFirst, you’ll load the sample metadata from the same file you saw last week. To do so, use the read_tsv() function you also saw in the homework – this reads a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file into a dataframe:\n\nmeta_raw &lt;- read_tsv(\"/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/data/meta/metadata.tsv\")\n\nLet’s take a look at the resulting dataframe with the View() function:\n\n# View() will open the dataframe in a spreadsheet like view\nView(meta_raw)\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 22 × 3\n   sample_id   time  treatment  \n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1 ERR10802882 10d   cathemerium\n 2 ERR10802875 10d   cathemerium\n 3 ERR10802879 10d   cathemerium\n 4 ERR10802883 10d   cathemerium\n 5 ERR10802878 10d   control    \n 6 ERR10802884 10d   control    \n 7 ERR10802877 10d   control    \n 8 ERR10802881 10d   control    \n 9 ERR10802876 10d   relictum   \n10 ERR10802880 10d   relictum   \n11 ERR10802885 10d   relictum   \n12 ERR10802886 10d   relictum   \n13 ERR10802864 24h   cathemerium\n14 ERR10802867 24h   cathemerium\n15 ERR10802870 24h   cathemerium\n16 ERR10802866 24h   control    \n17 ERR10802869 24h   control    \n18 ERR10802863 24h   control    \n19 ERR10802871 24h   relictum   \n20 ERR10802874 24h   relictum   \n21 ERR10802865 24h   relictum   \n22 ERR10802868 24h   relictum   \n\n\n\n Exercise: Interpret the metadata\nBased on the information in the table, try to understand the experimental design. How many timepoints and treatments are there? How many biological replicates?\n\n\nClick to see the solution\n\n\nThe time column contains the amount of time after infection, where “h” is short for hours.\nThe treatment column contains the treatment: which Plasmodium species, or “control” (not infected).\nAll in all, there are 3 treatments across each of 2 timepoints, with 3-4 replicates per treatment-timepoint combination.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll now have to make some modifications to the metadata table so that it can be used in DESeq2:\n\nThe table should be sorted by sample ID: we can use the arrange() function to do so\nThe sample IDs should be row names, not a separate column: we can use the column_to_rownames() function for this\n\n\n# The input is the raw metadata dataframe ('meta_raw'),\n# and we'll store the output in a new, processed dataframe ('meta'):\nmeta &lt;- meta_raw |&gt;\n  # 1. Sort the table by 'sample_id' column:\n  arrange(sample_id) |&gt;\n  # 2. Turn the 'sample_id' column into row names:\n  column_to_rownames(\"sample_id\")\n\n\n# Take a look at the first 6 rows\nhead(meta)\n\n            time   treatment\nERR10802863  24h     control\nERR10802864  24h cathemerium\nERR10802865  24h    relictum\nERR10802866  24h     control\nERR10802867  24h cathemerium\nERR10802868  24h    relictum\n\n\nIn the two outputs above, note the difference between having the sample IDs as a separate column versus as row names. This is a minor and uninteresting technical difference, but DESeq2 simply expects the sample IDs to be row names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analyzing data sets, such modifications (“data wrangling”) are quite common and can take up more time and space than the actual analysis itself. Which is one reason we’re including these steps in the lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Count table\nI produced a gene count table for you by running the nf-core rnaseq pipeline on the input data you saw last week (FASTQ reads and reference genome files).\nLoad this count table into R:\n\ncount_df &lt;- read_tsv(\"/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/results/counts.tsv\")\n\nTake a look at the first 6 rows:\n\nhead(count_df)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 24\n  gene_id gene_name ERR10802863 ERR10802864 ERR10802865 ERR10802866 ERR10802867\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ATP6    ATP6         10275.       8255.       4103.      18615.      11625.  \n2 ATP8    ATP8             3.85        2.92        2.33        7.76        7.01\n3 COX1    COX1         88041.      83394.      36975.     136054.     130863.  \n4 COX2    COX2          8749.       7925.       2901.      16802.      10026.  \n5 COX3    COX3         55772.      50312.      35074.      80510.      69850.  \n6 CYTB    CYTB         38543.      36352.      22185.      62147.      57461.  \n# ℹ 17 more variables: ERR10802868 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802869 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802870 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ERR10802871 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802874 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802875 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802876 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ERR10802877 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802878 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802879 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802880 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ERR10802881 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802882 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802883 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802884 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   ERR10802885 &lt;dbl&gt;, ERR10802886 &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nHere, too, we have to make several modifications – DESeq2 expects that the count table:\n\nHas gene IDs as row names\nDoes not contain any non-numeric columns\nContains integer (whole-number, rounded) values\nIs a “matrix”, a slighly different object type from a dataframe\n\n\ncount_mat &lt;- count_df |&gt;\n  # 1.

This will help answer questions like:\n\nDo the samples cluster by treatment (infection status) and/or time point?\nWhich of these two variables has a greater effect on overall patterns of gene expression?\nIs there an overall interaction between these two variables?\n\nFirst, you have to normalize the count data to account for differences in library size among samples and to “stabilize” the variance among genes1:\n\ndds_vst &lt;- varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds)\n\nThe authors of the study did this as well:\n\nWe carried out a Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST) of the counts to represent the samples on a PCA plot.\n\nNext, you can run and plot the PCA with a single function call, plotPCA from DESeq2:\n\n# With 'intgroup', you specify the variables (columns) to color samples by\nplotPCA(dds_vst, intgroup = c(\"time\", \"treatment\"))\n\nusing ntop=500 top features by variance\n\n\nWarning: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.\nℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`.\nℹ See also `vignette(\"ggplot2-in-packages\")` for more information.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the DESeq2 package.\n  Please report the issue to the authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise: Interpret the PCA result\n\nBased on the above PCA plot, try to answer the three questions asked at the beginning of this PCA section.\nHow does your plot compare to the PCA plot in the paper (Figure 1), in terms of the conclusions you drew in the previous question?\n\n\nClick to see the paper’s Figure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bonus exercise 1: Number of genes in the PCA\nBy default, the PCA run by plotPCA() does not summarize the variation in all genes, but only in the top 500 most variable genes. This tends to be a good representation of overall patterns, but it can be a good idea to check how robust the results are to this choice.\nThe plotPCA() function has an argument to change the number of included genes.\n\nFigure out what the name of this argument is by check the help for the function.\n(Hint: run ?plotPCA in the R console)\nPlay around with different numbers of included genes (e.g., 100, 1000, all genes), and see how this affects the PCA plot.\n\nTODO - ADD SOLUTION\n\n\n Bonus exercise 2: Make a better PCA plot\nCustomize the PCA plot to make it better-looking and clearer.\nFor example, in the plot we made above, each combination of time point and treatment has a distinct color. But it would be better to use point color only to distinguish one of the variables, and point shape to distinguish the other variable, as was done in the paper’s Fig. 1.\nFirst, you’ll need to get the data in a format that you can use to build the plot from scratch. You can do this by using the returnData = TRUE argument of the plotPCA() function (check the first solution below for more details if needed).\nThen, the plot customization will require some knowledge of ggplot2. If you don’t know how to do this yet, you can also try to use generative AI (Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) to help you write the code.\n\n\nPartial solution: getting the dataframe\n\nTo be able to customize the plot properly, it’s best to build it from scratch ourselves, rather than using the plotPCA function. But then how do we get the input data in the right shape?\nA nice trick is that we can use returnData = TRUE in the plotPCA function, to get plot-ready formatted data instead of an actual plot:\n\npca_df &lt;- plotPCA(\n  dds_vst,\n  ntop = 500,\n  intgroup = c(\"time\", \"treatment\"),\n  returnData = TRUE\n  )\n\nusing ntop=500 top features by variance\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see a possible solution\n\n\npca_df |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = treatment, shape = time)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\", name = \"Infection status\") +\n  scale_shape(name = \"Time points\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s improve this plot in two ways:\n\nAdding the percentage of variance explained by each principal component to the axes labels.\n\n\n# First extract and store the percentage of variance explained by different\n# principal components, so you can later add this information to the plot:\npct_var &lt;- round(100 * attr(pca_df, \"percentVar\"), 1)\npct_var\n\n[1] 85.3  3.1\n\npca_df |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = treatment, shape = time)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n  labs(\n    x = paste0(\"PC1 (\", pct_var[1], \"%)\"),\n    y = paste0(\"PC2 (\", pct_var[2], \"%)\")\n    ) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\", name = \"Infection status\") +\n  scale_shape(name = \"Time points\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving the order of the legend items: 24 hours should come before 10 days, and the control treatment is best presented first.\n\n\n# First, modify the factor levels in the PCA dataframe:\npca_df |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    time = factor(time, levels = c(\"24h\", \"10d\")),\n    treatment = factor(treatment, levels = c(\"control\", \"relictum\", \"cathemerium\"))\n    ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = treatment, shape = time)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n  labs(\n    x = paste0(\"PC1 (\", pct_var[1], \"%)\"),\n    y = paste0(\"PC2 (\", pct_var[2], \"%)\")\n    ) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\", name = \"Infection status\") +\n  scale_shape(name = \"Time points\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())"

    "text": "5 Differential Expression (DE) analysis\n\n5.1 Figuring out how to do the analysis\nFirst, let’s see how the DE analysis was done in the paper:\n\nThen, we used the DESeq2 package (Love et al., 2014) to perform the differential gene expression analysis comparing: (i) P. relictum-infected mosquitoes vs. controls, (ii) P. cathemerium-infected mosquitoes vs. controls, and (iii) P. relictum-infected mosquitoes vs. P. cathemerium-infected mosquitoes.\n\nThis is not terribly detailed and could be interpreted in a couple of different ways. For example, they may have compared infection statuses by ignoring time points or by controlling for time points in various ways.\nIgnoring time would mean analyzing the full dataset (all time points) while only using the infection status as an independent variable, i.e. using the design ~treatment.\n\n Your Turn\nGiven the PCA results, do you think we can ignore the time variable?\n\n\nClick to see the answer\n\nTODO ADD SOLUTION\n\n\nControlling for time can be done in two ways:\n\nAn analysis with two independent variables (factors): ~ time + treatment\nPairwise comparisons between each combination of time and treatment\n\nIf you take a look at Table 1 with the DE results, it should become clearer how they did their analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your Turn\nHow do you interpret this: did they run pairwise comparisons or a two-factor model?\n\n\nClick to see the answer\n\nIt looks like they performed pairwise comparisons between each combination of time and treatment.\n\n\nThat brings us a step closer, but pairwise comparisons with more than independent variable can (also!) be done in two ways (and it’s not clear from the paper which they used):\n\nAfter subsetting the dataset to each combination of time and treatment.\nAfter creating a single, combined independent variable that is a combination of time and treatment.\n\nThe latter method is the more common one, and is what we will use below.\n\n\n5.2 Setting the statistical design\nYou will now create a new variable that is a combination of treatment and time, and call it group:\n\n# Create a combined variable called 'group':\ngroup &lt;- paste(dds$treatment, dds$time, sep = \"_\")\n\n# Turn this into a 'factor' and add it to the DESeq2 object:\n# (Factors are a common R data type for categorical variables, and required by DESeq2)\ndds$group &lt;- factor(group)\n\nTake a look at the variable you created:\n\ndds$group\n\n [1] control_24h     cathemerium_24h relictum_24h    control_24h    \n [5] cathemerium_24h relictum_24h    control_24h     cathemerium_24h\n [9] relictum_24h    relictum_24h    cathemerium_10d relictum_10d   \n[13] control_10d     control_10d     cathemerium_10d relictum_10d   \n[17] control_10d     cathemerium_10d cathemerium_10d control_10d    \n[21] relictum_10d    relictum_10d   \n6 Levels: cathemerium_10d cathemerium_24h control_10d ... relictum_24h\n\n\nWhich unique values does group have, and how many samples are in each? We can use the table() function for this:\n\ntable(dds$group)\n\n\ncathemerium_10d cathemerium_24h     control_10d     control_24h    relictum_10d \n              4               3               4               3               4 \n   relictum_24h \n              4 \n\n\nNext, set the analysis design:\n\n# Note: the symbol before 'group' is a tilde, ~ \ndesign(dds) &lt;- ~ group\n\nPhew, now you’re finally ready to run the DE analysis!\n\n\n5.3 Running the DE analysis\nWhile you had to do a lot of prep to get here, actually running the DE analysis is very simple. It can be done with the function DESeq(), and we only need to give it the DESeq2 object, since the analysis options are already specified in the object itself:\n\n# (Note that the output is assigned back to the same `dds` object -\n#  the DE results are added to it)\ndds &lt;- DESeq(dds)\n\nestimating size factors\n\n\nestimating dispersions\n\n\ngene-wise dispersion estimates\n\n\nmean-dispersion relationship\n\n\nfinal dispersion estimates\n\n\nfitting model and testing\n\n\nThe DESeq() function performs three steps consecutively:\n\n“Normalization” by library size and composition\nEstimation of gene-wise variance in counts (“dispersion”)\nFitting the statistical model (a negative binomial GLM) and calculating the test statistics\n\nA key thing to understand is that above, DESeq2 automatically performed pairwise comparisons between each of the (6) levels of the group variable. This means that for any individual gene, it tested whether the gene is differentially expressed separately for each of these pairwise comparisons.\nTODO - VISUALIZE THIS?"

We might want to try a plot with a stricter p-value cut-off that does show the gene labels.\nPlay around with the p-value cut-off and the labeling to create a plot you like.\nCheck the vignette , or the help page (accessed by running ?EnhancedVolcano) to see how you can do this.\n\n\nClick for an example\n\n\nEnhancedVolcano(\n  toptable = res_rc24,      \n  title = \"relictum vs. control at 24 hpi\",\n  x = \"log2FoldChange\",     \n  y = \"padj\",             \n  lab = rownames(res_rc24), \n  labSize = 4,               # Now we will show the gene labels\n  pCutoff = 10e-10,          # Modify the p-value cut-off\n  subtitle = NULL,           # I'll also remove the silly subtitle\n  caption = NULL,            # ... and the caption\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bonus Exercise: Which gene is my outlier?\nFigure out the identity of the abovementioned log2-fold change outlier.\n(You can do so either by labeling it in the plot, or by filtering the res_rc24 table.)\n\n\nClick for the solution on how to label it in the plot\n\n\n\nEnhancedVolcano(\n  toptable = res_rc24,      \n  title = \"relictum vs. control at 24 hpi\",\n  x = \"log2FoldChange\",     \n  y = \"padj\",             \n  lab = rownames(res_rc24), \n  labSize = 4,               \n  pCutoff = 0.05,            # Modify the p-value cut-off\n  FCcutoff = 20,             # Modify the LFC cut-off\n  )\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_vline()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick for the solution on how to find it in the results table\n\n\n\nas.data.frame(res_rc24) |&gt; filter(log2FoldChange &gt; 20)\n\n              baseMean log2FoldChange    lfcSE     stat       pvalue\nLOC120413430  7.540043       24.46898 5.397990 4.532979           NA\nLOC120431476 39.720375       23.01445 5.301369 4.341228 1.416885e-05\n                     padj\nLOC120413430           NA\nLOC120431476 0.0008584396\n\n\n(Interestingly, there’s a second gene with a LFC &gt; 20 that we hadn’t seen in the plot, because it has NA as the pvalue and padj. See the section “Extra info: NA values in the results table” in the Appendix above for why p-values can be set to NA.)\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Plot specific genes\nIt can also be very informative to look at plots of expression levels for individual genes, especially for those with highly significant differential expression.\nLet’s plot the single most highly significant DEG. We can get the ID of this gene as follows:\n\n# Convert the results table into a regular dataframe and sort by adjusted p-value:\ntop_df &lt;- data.frame(res_rc24) |&gt; arrange(padj)\n\n# Gene IDs are the row names: extract the first row name to get the gene of interest\ntop1 &lt;- rownames(top_df)[1]\ntop1\n\n[1] \"LOC120423768\"\n\n\nLike it does for PCA, DESeq2 also has a gene plotting function. This will by default plot normalized gene counts.\n\nplotCounts(dds, gene = top1, intgroup = \"group\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have to drag the right-hand pane in RStudio way to the left in order to see all the x-axis labels…\n\n\n\nIn the above plot, we’re not just seeing the difference between relictum_24h and control_24h, but are seeing expression levels for all four treatment-time combinations. That may not always be what you want, but it is useful to see the expression patterns across all groups.\nHere, the pattern suggests … TODO\n\n Exercise: Plot additional DE genes\nPlot one or a few more of the top-DE genes. Do they have similar expression patterns across treatment and time points as the first one?\nTODO ADD SOLUTION\n\n\n Bonus exercise: Plot the outlier gene\nPlot the gene with the very high LFC value that you saw when making the volcano plot. How would you interpret this result?\n\n\nClick to get the ID of the outlier gene\n\nA previous bonus exercise showed you how to find the ID of the outlier gene. It is: LOC120431476.\n\n\n\nClick for the solution\n\n\nplotCounts(dds, gene = \"LOC120431476\", intgroup = \"group\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! It looks like in every single time + treatment combinations, all but one (or in one case, two) of the samples have zero expression, but there are several extreme outliers.\nOur focal comparison is control_24h vs. relictum_24h, and it looks like the difference between these two groups is solely due to the one outlier in relictum. Nevertheless, even the multiple-testing corrected p-value (padj) is significant for this gene:\n\nas.data.frame(res_rc24) |&gt;\n  rownames_to_column(\"gene\") |&gt;\n  filter(gene == \"LOC120431476\")\n\n          gene baseMean log2FoldChange    lfcSE     stat       pvalue\n1 LOC120431476 39.72038       23.01445 5.301369 4.341228 1.416885e-05\n          padj\n1 0.0008584396\n\n\nSo, you have to be careful with talking these statistical results at face value, and need to visualize important genes!\n\n\n\n Bonus exercise: Make a better gene expression plot\nThe default plotCounts() function creates a rather basic plot. Customize the plot with ggplot2 to make it better-looking and clearer.\n\n\nSolution part 1: getting the dataframe\n\nBelow, you’ll use that DESeq2 function, but only to extract the counts for our gene of interest in a format for plotting, by adding returnData = TRUE:\n\n# Use plotCounts with returnData = TRUE just to get a single-gene count table\n# that is suitable for plotting:\nfocal_gene_counts &lt;- plotCounts(\n  dds,\n  gene = top1,\n  intgroup = c(\"time\", \"treatment\"),\n  returnData = TRUE\n  )\n\n# Take a look at the resulting dataframe:\nhead(focal_gene_counts)\n\n                 count time   treatment\nERR10802863 1543.81532  24h     control\nERR10802864 2279.03704  24h cathemerium\nERR10802865   25.42295  24h    relictum\nERR10802866 1105.75009  24h     control\nERR10802867 1199.28425  24h cathemerium\nERR10802868   32.14394  24h    relictum\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution part 2: Making the plot\n\n\nfocal_gene_counts |&gt;\n  # By converting 'time' and 'treatment' columns into \"factors\",\n  # you can provide a custom order that will be respected in the plot -\n  # this, way 24h comes before 10d, and control before the two infections.\n  mutate(\n    time = factor(time, levels = c(\"24h\", \"10d\")),\n    treatment = factor(treatment, levels = c(\"control\", \"cathemerium\", \"relictum\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Treatment along the x-axis, gene counts along the y, color by treatment:\n  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = count, fill = treatment)) +\n  # Plot separate \"facets\" with the different time points\n  facet_wrap(vars(time)) +\n  # Add a boxplot with a partly transparaent (alpha) color:\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, outlier.shape = NA) +\n  # _And_ add individual points:\n  geom_point(\n    size = 4,\n    shape = 21,\n    position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, heigth = 0)\n    ) +\n  # Plot styling (e.g., we don't need a legend)\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")"

    "text": "9 Appendix\n\n9.1 Exporting the results\nYou may be wondering how you can save the DE results tables to files. You can do this with a writing counterpart to read_tsv() called, you guessed it, write_tsv().
