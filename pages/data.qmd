## Introduction

### Goals for this part of the lab

In this second part of the lab, you will learn how to:

1. Look at files in the Unix shell
2. Find a reference genome and the associated files
3. Explore and understand reference genome files
4. Explore and understand HTS files
5. Perform quality-control on HTS reads with a command-line tool, FastQC

### The dataset

As discussed in the lecture,
you'll work with RNA-Seq data from @garrigós2025 in today's and next week's labs:

![](../img/paper.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

This paper used RNA-Seq data to study gene expression in
*Culex pipiens* mosquitos infected with malaria-causing *Plasmodium* protozoans.
Next week, you will learn about RNA-Seq methodology and experimental design,
and we'll discuss the paper's experimental design in more detail.
Here, we'll explore the paper's HTS data files.

## The files you'll work with

The main data files in a reference-based HTS project^[
That is, an HTS project where reads can be mapped to a reference genome.]
are sequence reads
(usually produced for the focal project) and
reference genome files (usually already available).

For this project --our re-analysis of the @garrigós2025 data--
I have downloaded those files for you and placed them in
`/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/data` on OSC.
You've seen some of these files in the first part of this lab,
but we didn't pay much attention to what they represent.

First, we'll actually move one level up to the `ENT6703` dir:

```bash
cd /fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703
```

Let's get an overview of the full set of files using the `tree` command
(with the option `-C` to show colors): 

```bash
# Unlike ls, tree will show the full directory structure
tree -C data
```
```bash-out
# (The colors you should see in the terminal aren't shown here)
data
├── fastq
│   ├── ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz
│   ├── ERR10802863_R2.fastq.gz
│   ├── ERR10802864_R1.fastq.gz
│   ├── ERR10802864_R2.fastq.gz

    ├── GCF_016801865.2.fna
    └── GCF_016801865.2.gtf
3 directories, 48 files
```

So, we have:

- A whole bunch of FASTQ files (`.fastq.gz` extension) which contain the HTS reads
- Two reference genomes files representing the assembly/sequence (`.fna`) and the
  annotation table (`.gtf`)
- A sample metadata file with treatment information for each sample

**All these files are plain-text files**,
which is one reason why the Unix shell excells at working with them.
You'll take a closer look at each below.

<details><summary>{{< fa comments >}} Looking at the `tree` output, what is the (full) path to the file `metadata.tsv`? *(Click to expand)*</summary>
The path is `/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/data/meta/metadata.tsv`.
</details>

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Side note: How you could retrieve this data yourself *(Click to expand)*

At the end of the @garrigós2025 paper,
there is a section called "Open Research" with a "Data Availability Statement",
which reads:

> Raw sequences generated in this study have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive ENA database (<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home>) under project accession number PRJEB41609, Study ERP125411. Sample metadata are available at <https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/15708>.

The project accession number `PRJEB41609` can be used to download the reads
in various ways.
Because of the large amount of data involved,
it's convenient to download them directly to OSC rather than first to your own
computer.
One way to do this is to use the [SRA Explorer](https://sra-explorer.info/) website,
where you can enter the project accession number and get download links so
you can download the files with simple commands.

The second link can be used to download the sample metadata.
:::

### The sample metadata

Let's start by taking a quick look at a table with information about
the samples analyzed in this paper, which we'll call the sample metadata.
This file, `metadata.tsv`, is a small tabular plain-text file,
with columns separated by Tabs (TSV/`.tsv` is short for "Tab-Separated Values"):

```bash
ls -lh data/meta
```
```bash-out
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 644 Jan 21 09:15 metadata.tsv
```

Use the `cat` command (short for catenate/concatenate)
to show the file contents in the shell:

```bash
cat meta/metadata.tsv
```
```bash-out
sample_id       dpi     treatment
ERR10802864     1       cathemerium
ERR10802867     1       cathemerium
ERR10802870     1       cathemerium
ERR10802866     1       control
ERR10802869     1       control
ERR10802863     1       control
ERR10802871     1       relictum
ERR10802874     1       relictum
ERR10802865     1       relictum
ERR10802868     1       relictum
ERR10802882     10      cathemerium
ERR10802875     10      cathemerium
ERR10802879     10      cathemerium
ERR10802883     10      cathemerium
ERR10802878     10      control
ERR10802884     10      control
ERR10802877     10      control
ERR10802881     10      control
ERR10802876     10      relictum
ERR10802880     10      relictum
ERR10802885     10      relictum
ERR10802886     10      relictum
```

There are 22 samples in total, with two variables of interest:

- `dpi` --- time of sampling in Days Post-Infection
- `treatment` --- treatment group: infection status

Each `treatment`-`dpi` combination has replicates to allow for statistical
comparisons.
As mentioned, we'll discuss these aspects of the experimental design in more
detail next week.

## Reference genome files

There are two main types of reference genome files needed for a HTS project
like reference-based RNA-Seq:

1. The **genome assembly**,
   i.e. the nucleotide sequence of each chromosome/scaffold.
   These are stored in the simple **FASTA** format.

2. The **genome annotation**,
   i.e. a table with the positions of genes and other so-called genomic features
   on each chromosome/scaffold.
   These are commonly stored in **GTF** or similar formats.
   
Below, after seeing how you can obtain such files, we'll focus on exploring
the genome assembly FASTA file.

### Finding a reference genome

Imagine you are one of the researchers involved in the *Culex* study.
You'd want to find out if a *Culex pipiens* reference genome is available,
and if so, download the relevant files.
The authors state the following in the paper:

> Because the reference genome and annotations of *Cx. pipiens* are not published yet, we used the reference genome and annotations of phylogenetically closest species that were available in Ensembl, *Cx. quinquefasciatus*.

As discussed in the lecture, reference genomes of closely related species can
generally be used if no genome is available for the focal species,
but it's always best to use a genome of the exact species if possible.
We also saw that new reference genomes are rapidly being published.
So perhaps a reference genome of *Culex pipiens* has become available in the meantime?

Generally, the first place to look for reference genome data is at NCBI,
<https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>,
where you can start by simply typing the name of your organism in the search box
at the home page.
By means of example, let's first search for the hoverfly *Episyrphus balteatus*:

![](../img/refgenome_search.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

You should get the following box at the top of the results:

![](../img/refgenome_result1b.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

If you then click on "Genomes", you should see the following table^[As of January, 2026.]:

![](../img/refgenome_result2b.png){fig-align="center" width="95%"}

So, NCBI has 5 genomes assemblies for *Episyrphus balteatus*. The top one:

- Has a green check mark next to it,
  which means that this genome has been designated the primary reference genome
  for the focal organism.
- Is the only one with an entry in the `RefSeq` column,
  which means it has an (NCBI) annotation available.

That top assembly, `idEpiBalt1.1`, would therefore be the one to choose,
unless you have project-specific reasons to use one of the other assemblies
(e.g., a genome from a specific population/lineage).

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: A _Culex pipiens_ reference genome

1. Now search for *Culex pipiens*.
   How many *Culex pipiens* genomes are on NCBI, and if so, which would you pick?

   <details><summary>*Click for the solution*</summary>
    
   Go through the same process as shown above for the fruitfly,
   now entering `Culex pipiens` in the search box.
    
   You should find that there are 5 *Culex pipiens* assemblies.
   Very much like for the fruitfly, as it happens,
   the first one (`TS_CPP_V2`) is the only with a reference checkmark next to it and
   an entry in the `RefSeq` column:
    
   ![](../img/refgenome_culex_pipiens.png){fig-align="center" width="95%"}
    
   So, there *is* currently a reference genome for *Cx. pipiens* available,
   and we'll be using that one:
   the files you've seen in the `ref` dir are for that genome.
   </details>

2. You can click on each assembly to get more information,
   including statistics like the number of scaffolds.
   Take a closer look at our focal genome on the NCBI website.
   What is the size of the genome assembly?
   How many chromosomes and scaffolds does it contain?
   And how many protein-coding genes? 

   <details><summary>*Click for the solution*</summary>
   On the
   [genome's page at NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_016801865.2/),
   it says that the genome assembly has:
   
   - A size of 566.3 Mb (Megabases)
   - 3 chromosomes and 289 unplaced scaffolds
   - 16,297 protein-coding genes annotated
  
   See these screenshots:

   ![](../img/refannot_stats.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}
  
  </details>

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Side note: How you can download reference genome files *(Click to expand)*

If you wanted to download the reference genome files from the NCBI website,
you could either select an assembly in the overview table and click the `Download` button,
or click the `Download` button at the top of the page for a specific assembly.
That should get you the following pop-up window:

![](../img/refgenome_download.png){fig-align="center" width="55%"}

You'll want to select at least the "*Genome sequences (FASTA)*"
and one or both of the "*Annotation features*" files
(GTF is often preferred with RNA-Seq).

This allows you to download the data to your computer,
and you could then upload it OSC.
Though a faster and more reproducible solution would be to use a *command* in your
OSC shell to directly download these —
the `datasets` and `curl` buttons next to the `Download` one a genome's page
help with that.
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
#### Side note: Reference genome complications *(Click to expand)*

Other useful database for reference genomes are [Ensembl](https://ensembl.org) and
specialized databases that exist for certain organisms,
like [FlyBase](https://flybase.org/) for *Drosophila*,
[VectorBase](https://vectorbase.org/) mostly for mosquitos,
and [JGI Phytozome](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/) for plants.

In many cases,
these databases *don't contain the exact same reference genome files than NCBI*.
Often, at least the annotation is different,
but even the assembly may have small differences including in chromosome/scaffold names,
which can make these files completely incompatible.
And to make matters even more complicated,
it is not always clear which database is the best source for your genome.
:::

### The genome assembly FASTA file

#### The FASTA format

FASTA files contain one or more DNA or amino acid sequences,
with no limits on the number of sequences or the sequence lengths.
FASTA is a ubiquitous format in genetics and genomics --
it is the standard format for, e.g.:

- Genome assembly sequences
- Transcriptomes and proteomes
  (all of an organism's transcripts & amino acid sequences, respectively)
- Sequence downloads from NCBI such as a single gene/protein or other GenBank entry

The following example FASTA file contains two entries:

```bash-in-nocolor
>unique_sequence_ID Optional description
ATTCATTAAAGCAGTTTATTGGCTTAATGTACATCAGTGAAATCATAAATGCTAAAAA
>unique_sequence_ID2
ATTCATTAAAGCAGTTTATTGGCTTAATGTACATCAGTGAAATCATAAATGCTAAATG
```

Each FASTA entry consists of:

1. A **header** line that starts with a `>` (greater-than sign) and provides an identifier
   and optionally additional information about the sequence^[
   There are no universal standards for the header line format,
   but individual programs and databases may expect specific formats.]
2. A nucleotide or amino acid **sequence** (which can span 1 or several/many lines)

#### The *Culex* genome assembly FASTA file

The *Culex pipiens* reference genome files are in the `ref` directory:

``` bash
ls -lh data/ref
```
```bash-out
-rw------- 1 jelmer PAS0471 547M Jan 22 12:34 GCF_016801865.2.fna
-rw------- 1 jelmer PAS0471 123M Jan 22 12:34 GCF_016801865.2.gtf
```

The FASTA file is `GCF_016801865.2.fna` and is quite large (547 Mb).
`cat` isn't a great command to take a peek at such a large file,
because it will print all of it to screen 😳.

Yet the Unix shell more broadly is actually excellent for exploring such files,
because visual text editors (say, Notepad or TextEdit) would have lots of trouble
opening these large files^[The reason is that they try to load them into RAM memory entirely,
even if you just want to see the first few lines.].

A great command to easily view text files of any size is **`less`**,
which opens them up in a "pager" within your shell -- 
you'll see what that means if you try it with one of the assembly FASTA file:

```bash
less data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.fna
```
```bash-out

```

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Explore the file with `less`

After running the above command,
the file should have "opened" inside the `less` pager.

Move around in the file and explore it a bit,
which you can do in several ways:
by scrolling with your mouse, with up and down arrows, or, if you have them,
<kbd>PgUp</kbd> and <kbd>PgDn</kbd> keys
(also, <kbd>u</kbd> will move up half a page and
<kbd>d</kbd> will move down half a page).

How many FASTA entries are you seeing in the part of the file you explored?

::: {.callout-tip appearance=simple}
Notice that you are "inside" this pager and won't have your shell prompt back
until you **press** <kbd>q</kbd> to quit `less`.
:::
:::

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
#### Side note: Lowercase vs. uppercase nucleotide letters *(Click to expand)*

As you have probably noticed,
nucleotide bases are typically typed in uppercase (`A`, `C`, `G`, `T`).
What does the mixture of lowercase and uppercase bases in the *Cx. pipiens* assembly
FASTA mean, then?

Lowercase bases are "soft-masked": they are repetitive sequences,
and bioinformatics programs can treat them differently than non-repetitive sequences,
which are in uppercase.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Side note: Several file extensions are used for FASTA files (*Click to expand*)

- You may see files with any of the following file extensions:
  `.fa`, `.fasta`, `.fna`, `.faa`
- Of these, "generic" extensions are `.fasta` and `.fa`
  (e.g: `culex_assembly.fasta`)
- The other extensions explicitly indicate whether sequences are
  *nucleotides* (`.fna`) or *amino acids* (`.faa`)
  
These extensions are mainly used to help users quickly identify the sequence type:
the underlying format is the same in all cases.
:::

### Annotation files

As you've seen, the genome assembly FASTA file merely contains the sequences of
the chromosomes/scaffolds.
How do you know where on these sequences genes are located?
That's where the _annotation_ comes in,
which in this case is stored in a GTF file (`GCF_016801865.2.gtf`).

We won't explore the GTF annotation file
(but check the [Appendix](#appendix) in your own time if you're interested),
but it is basically a large table with information about the positions of genes
and other genomic features.
While the actual format isn't quite as simple as this, the basic idea is as follows:

```bash-out-solo
chromosome      feature  start  end   strand
--------------------------------------------
chromosome1     gene1    17     1356   +
chromosome1     gene2    4902   5041   +
```

Among other things, this information allows you (and tools that can do it for you)
to _extract_ gene sequences from the genome assembly FASTA file.

## FASTQ files

### The FASTQ format

FASTQ is the standard HTS read data file format.
Just like the FASTA format, it contains sequences, but in FASTQ,
these are accompanied by _quality scores_
(hence FASTQ as in "Q" for "quality").

Each read is represented by **four lines**:

1. A **header** that starts with **`@`** and e.g. uniquely identifies the read
2. The **sequence** itself
3. A plus sign, **`+`**
4. One-character ASCII **quality scores** for each base 

![The FASTQ format.](../img/fastq_dark.png){fig-align="center" width="92%" fig-alt="An annotated screenshot of two reads in a FASTQ file." .lightbox}

Each ASCII character in the quality line corresponds to a numeric "Phred"
quality score ($Q$) that is a function of the estimated _error_ probability
for a base call ($P$):

$$
Q = -10 * log_{10}(P)
$$

Some specific probabilities and their rough qualitative interpretation for Illumina data:

| Phred quality score | Error probability | Rough interpretation | ASCII in FASTQ
|:------:|--------|-------|:------:|
| **10**              | 1 in 10           | terrible             | `+` |
| **20**              | 1 in 100          | bad                  | `5` |
| **30**              | 1 in 1,000        | good                 | `?` |
| **40**              | 1 in 10,000       | excellent            | `I` |

: {.striped .hover}

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

<details><summary>{{< fa comments >}} But why use those ASCII characters and not just numbers in the quality line? _(Click to see the solution)_</summary>

First, to be clear, the question that arises is this:
the numeric Phred quality score is represented in FASTQ files by a "ASCII character"
corresponding to the number rather than the number itself.
That seems roundabout and harder to understand. So why is this done?

This is done because it allows for a **single-character** representation of each
possible score — such that
*each quality score character can correspond to (& line up with)*
*a base character in the read.*

For your reference,
[here is a complete lookup table](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/quality_score.html)
to convert the ASCII characters to Phred quality scores
(look at the top table, `BASE=33`).
<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />
</details>

### FASTQ file sizes and organization

Let's take another look at the list of FASTQ files:

```bash
ls -lh data/fastq
```
```bash-out
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 21M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 22M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802863_R2.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 21M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802864_R1.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 22M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802864_R2.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 22M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802865_R1.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 22M Jan 21 13:36 ERR10802865_R2.fastq.gz
[...truncated...]
```

In the file listing above:

- First, take note of the file sizes.
  They are merely about 22 Mb in size, and all have a very similar size.
  This is because I "subsampled" the FASTQ files, only retaining 500,000 reads per file.
  _The original files were on average over 1 Gb in size with about 30 million reads._

- Second, if you look closely at the file names,
  it looks like there are two FASTQ files per sample:
  one with `_R1` at the end of the file name, and one with `_R2`.

<details><summary>{{< fa comments >}} What might each of these two files per sample represent/contain? *(Click for the solution)*</summary>
These contain the forward reads (`_R1.fastq.gz`) vs. the reverse reads (`_R2.fastq.gz`).
</details>

<details><summary>{{< fa comments >}} Do you have any idea why the file extension ends in `.gz`? *(Click for the solution)*</summary>
This means the file is **compressed**, specifically with a program called "gzip".
This saves a lot of space:
compressed files can be up to 10 times smaller than uncompressed files.
Most bioinformatics tools, including the FastQC program we'll run in a bit,
can work with gzipped files directly, so there is no need to decompress them.
</details>

### Viewing FASTQ files

Despite the file compression,
you can simply use the `less` command as before to view the FASTQ files:

```bash
less data/fastq/ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz
```
```bash-out
@ERR10802863.8435456 8435456 length=74

These only consist of `N` bases (and they are also shorter than the other reads),
and are therefore completely useless!

_(Note that it is generally *not* common to run into these kinds of failed reads as easily!)_
</details>
:::

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

While the above problematic reads were easy to spot,
you wouldn't typically perform quality control by manually inspecting FASTQ files.
There are simply too many reads to make sense of!
Instead, you can use **specialized tools like FastQC to summarize** FASTQ files --
that's what we'll do now.

## FastQC for quality control of HTS reads

FastQC is a very useful and widely used tool to perform
**quality control of HTS reads**.
For the budding computational biologist,
it is also a good first example of a bioinformatics/HTS analysis tool with a
command-line interface.

### Running FastQC

Command-line programs like FastQC are operated quite similarly to the Unix shell
commands you've seen.
To run FastQC, you use the command `fastqc`.

To analyze a FASTQ files with default FastQC settings,
a complete FastQC command would simply be `fastqc`,
followed by the name of the file as the argument:

```bash
fastqc data/fastq/ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz
```
```bash-out
bash: fastqc: command not found...
```

#### Loading the FastQC "module"

But of course, it can't be quite that simple -- we get an error!
While FastQC *is* installed at OSC[^5], we have to *"load it"* before use.
The finer details of using software at OSC are outside of the scope of this lab,
so here, please accept that we can load FastQC as follows:

```bash
module load fastqc/0.12.1
```

[^5]: For a full list of installed software at OSC: <https://www.osc.edu/resources/available_software/software_list>

#### Changing the output dir

Before trying again, you'll also make a chance to the command.
An ill-advised default behavior of FastQC is that it writes output files
in the dir where the input files are --
it's not good practice to directly mix data and results like that!

To figure out how we can change that behavior,
note that many commands and programs have an
**option `-h` and/or `--help`** to print usage information to the screen.

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Finding the output directory option

Print FastQC's help info,
and figure out which option you can use to specify an output dir of your choice.

<details><summary>*Click for the solution*</summary>
Both `fastqc -h` and `fastqc --help` will show the help info.
You'll get quite a bit of output printed to screen,
including this snippet about output directories:

``` bash
fastqc -h
```
```bash-out
  -o --outdir  Create all output files in the specified output directory.
               Please note that this directory must exist as the program
               will not create it.  If this option is not set then the 
               output file for each sequence file is created in the same
               directory as the sequence file which was processed.
```

This means that you can use `-o` or equivalently, `--outdir` to specify an output dir.
(Commands often have both short- and long-form options just for convenience.)
</details>
:::

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

You'll want to have FastQC write output to a deicated dir within the dir you
created in the first part of the lab.
For me, for example, a good choice would be `jelmer/fastqc`:

```bash
# Replace 'jelmer' with your own dir name 
fastqc --outdir jelmer/fastqc data/fastq/ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz
```
```bash-out
Specified output directory 'jelmer/fastqc' does not exist
```

But we get an error! 😡

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Fixing the output directory problem

What is going on this time? Can you try to fix the problem?

<details><summary>*If you know what the problem is, click here for a hint on how to fix it*</summary>
You can create a new directory in the OnDemand file explorer,
or use a command to create dirs.

For the latter option: the command `mkdir` can be used to create new dirs,
where you give the name/path of the dir you want to create as the argument:

```bash
# Replace 'DESIRED-OUTPUT-DIR' with the actual name we want to give the new dir
mkdir DESIRED-OUTPUT-DIR
```
</details>

<details><summary>*Click here for the solution*</summary>

- The problem, as the error message indicates,
  is that the output directory that we specified with `--outdir` does not exist.
  We might have expected FastQC to be smart/flexible enough to create this dir
  for us, but alas.
  To be fair, it did warn us about this in the Help info!

- You can create this dir in the OnDemand file explorer,
  but here I will show how to do it with a command:
  `mkdir` can be used to create new dirs.
  
  ```bash
  mkdir jelmer/fastqc
  ```
</details>
:::

Now that you've created the output directory,
let's give it a final try before throwing our laptops out the window:

```bash
fastqc --outdir jelmer/fastqc data/fastq/ERR10802863_R1.fastq.gz
```
```bash-out

### FastQC output files

Let's take a look at the files in the output dir you specified:

```bash
# [Replace 'jelmer' with your own dir name]
ls -lh jelmer/fastqc
```
```bash-out

```

- There is a `.zip` file --- this contains **tables** with FastQC's data summaries
- There is an `.html` (HTML) file -- this contains QC plots and is what we'll look at next

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Run FastQC for the R2 file

Run FastQC for the corresponding R2 FASTQ file.
Would you use the same output dir?

<details><summary>*Click here for the solution*</summary>
Yes, it makes sense to use the same output dir, since as you could see above,
the output file names have the input file identifiers in them.
As such, you don't need to worry about overwriting files,
and it will be easier to have all the results in a single dir.

To run FastQC for the R2 (=reverse-read) FASTQ file:

```bash
fastqc --outdir jelmer/fastqc data/fastq/ERR10802863_R2.fastq.gz
```
```bash-out

```

Now, you have four FastQC output files:
two for each of your preceding successful FastQC runs.
</details>
:::

## Interpreting FastQC's output

First, you'll have to download FastQC's output HTML files,
because you can't view them in the Unix shell^[
The Unix shell is great for plain-text file, but not for other types of files.].

1. Find the FastQC HTML files in the OnDemand Files menu file explorer.
2. Select the two files by clicking the check-box at the right,
   and click the Download bottom towards the top.
3. Download the file to somewhere on your computer
   (doesn't matter where), and your browser should give you a pop-up with the file
   you can click on to open it.
4. Since the file is in HTML format, it should **open in your web browser**.

![With the two HTML files selected, you can click the Download button at the top](../img/ondemand-fastqc-download.png){fig-align="center" width="80%" fig-alt="Screenshot of the OnDemand file explorer with FastQC HTML files selected for download." .lightbox}

We'll now go through a couple of the FastQC plots/modules,
with first some example plots^[
Some of the FastQC example plots were taken from
[here](https://rtsf.natsci.msu.edu/sites/_rtsf/assets/File/FastQC_TutorialAndFAQ_080717.pdf).
] with good/bad results for reference.

### Overview of module results

FastQC has "**pass**" (checkmark in green),
"**warning**" (exclamation mark in orange),
and "**fail**" (cross in red) assessments for each module,
as you can see below.

![](../img/fastqc_summary2.png){fig-align="center" width="30%"}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### More about the FastQC module assessments _(Click to expand)_
These pass/warning/fail assessments are handy and typically at least somewhat meaningful,
but you should realize that
*a "warning" or a "fail" is not necessarily the bad news that it may appear to be*.
That's because, for example:

- Some of these modules are rather strict, perhaps overly strict.
- Some warnings and fails are easily remedied or simply not a very big deal.
- FastQC assumes that your data is derived from whole-genome shotgun sequencing ---
  some other types of data like RNA-Seq data will always trigger a couple of warnings
  and files based on expected differences.
:::

### Basic statistics module

This section shows, for example, the number of sequences (reads) and the read
length range for your file:

![](../img/fastqc_mod01_basic-stats.png){fig-align="center" width="85%"}

### Per base quality graph

This figure visualize the mean per-base Phred quality score (as discussed above; y-axis)
along the length of the reads (x-axis). Note that:

- A decrease in sequence quality along the reads is normal
- R2 (reverse) reads are usually worse than R1 (forward) reads

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Good / acceptable:**

**Bad:**

![](../img/fastqc_bad.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

### Adapter content graph

Checks for known adapter sequences.
As you've learned, when an insert size is shorter than the read length,
adapters will end up in the sequence – these should be removed!

::::: columns

#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Interpreting the FastQC output

Open the HTML file for the R1 FASTQ file and go through the modules we discussed above.
Can you make sense of it?
Does the data look good to you, overall?

Now open the HTML file for the R2 FASTQ file and take a look just at the
quality score graph.
Does it look any worse than the R1?

## Prep for next week's lab

In next week's lab, you will be working in R, using RStudio,
to analyze the gene expression counts resulting from this RNA-Seq data.
You will have [homework](r_homework.qmd) to prepare for that lab.
To make that a bit easier for you,
I'll now demonstrate how to start an RStudio session at OSC:

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
It's necessary to fill out this form (instead of just opening RStudio)
because RStudio runs on a compute node rather than a login node.
Whenever you want to access a compute node, you need to request resources for it,
like this form does.
:::

1. Go to the [OnDemand homepage](https://ondemand.osc.edu) as before

2. Click on **`Interactive Apps`** (top bar) and then **`RStudio Server`**
   (all the way at the bottom)

3. Fill out the form as follows:

   - Cluster: **`cardinal`**
   - R version: **`4.4.0`**
   - Project: **`PAS2880`**
   - Number of hours: **`4`**
   - Node type: **`any`**
   - Number of cores: **`2`**

4. Click the big blue **`Launch`** button at the bottom

5. Now, you should be sent to a new page with a box at the top for your
   RStudio Server "job", which should initially be "Queued" (waiting to start).

6. Your job should start running very soon,
   with the top bar of the box turning green and saying "Running".

   <details><summary>*Click to see a screenshot*</summary>
   ![](../img/rstudio_running.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}
   </details>

7. Click **`Connect to RStudio Server`** at the bottom of the box,
   and an RStudio Server instance will open in a new browser tab.
   You're ready to go!

## In closing

In today's lab, you were introduced to:

- Working at the Ohio Supercomputer Center
- Using the Unix shell
- Reference genome files & where to find these
- HTS read FASTQ files and how to quality-control these
- How to run a command-line bioinformatics tool

Taking a step back, I've shown you the main pieces of the computational
infrastructure for what we may call "**command-line genomics**":
genomics analysis using command-line tools.
And you've seen a basic example of loading and running a command-line tool at OSC.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Side note: scaling the analysis & next steps for real projects (Click to expand)

For this brief intro to HTS data analysis, we've kept things simple.
In a typical HTS data analysis project, however,
there are some more pieces to the puzzle that we didn't cover today:

- Using a text editor with an integrated terminal (e.g., VS Code) to be able
  to write and edit scripts more easily
- Putting commands to run programs FastQC in a **"shell script"**.
- **Submitting the script** as a "batch job".
- To make speed things, using the OSC's capabilities,
  we can **submit multiple jobs *in parallel* using a loop**.

If it seems that speed and computing power may not be an issue,
given how fast FastQC ran, keep in mind that:

- We here worked with subsampled (much smaller than usual) FASTQ files
- We only ran FastQC for one of our 23 samples, and your experiment may have 50+ samples
- We need to run a bunch more tools,
  and some of those take much longer to run or need lots of computer resources.

All that said, those missing pieces mentioned above are outside the scope of this
short introduction --- but if you managed today,
it should not be hard to learn those skills either.

## Appendix: GTF files

### The GTF format

The GTF format is a tab-delimited tabular file format that contains
**genome annotations**, with:

- One row for each annotated "**genomic feature**" (gene, exon, etc.)
- One column for each piece of information about a feature, like its genomic coordinates

See the sample below,
with an added header line (*not normally present*) with column names:

``` bash-out-solo
seqname     source  feature start   end     score  strand  frame    attributes
NC_000001   RefSeq  gene    11874   14409   .       +       .       gene_id "DDX11L1"; transcript_id ""; db_xref "GeneID:100287102"; db_xref "HGNC:HGNC:37102"; description "DEAD/H-box helicase 11 like 1 (pseudogene)"; gbkey "Gene"; gene "DDX11L1"; gene_biotype "transcribed_pseudogene"; pseudo "true"; 
NC_000001   RefSeq  exon    11874   12227   .       +       .       gene_id "DDX11L1"; transcript_id "NR_046018.2"; db_xref "GeneID:100287102"; gene "DDX11L1"; product "DEAD/H-box helicase 11 like 1 (pseudogene)"; pseudo "true"; 
```

Some details on the more important/interesting columns:

- `seqname` — Name of the chromosome, scaffold, or contig
- `feature` — Name of the feature type, e.g. "gene", "exon", "intron", "CDS"
- `start` & `end` — Start & end position of the feature
- `strand` — Whether the feature is on the `+` (forward) or `-` (reverse) strand
- `attribute` — A semicolon-separated list of tag-value pairs with additional information

::: callout-note
#### Avoid line-wrapping with `less -S`

Lines in a file may contain too many characters to fit on your screen,
as will be the case for this GTF file.
`less` will by default "wrap" such lines onto the next line on your screen,
but this is often confusing for files like FASTQ and tabular files like GTF.
Therefore, we turned off line-wrapping above by using the `-S` option to `less`.
