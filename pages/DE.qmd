## Introduction

### Recap

[**Last week**](data.qmd), you explored the RNA-Seq reads from @garrigós2025
and the *Culex pipiens* reference genome files.

In [**yesterday's lecture**](rnaseq.qmd),
you learned about the steps to generate a gene count table from this input data:

1. **Read preprocessing**: QC, trimming, and optionally rRNA removal
2. **Alignment** of reads to a reference genome
3. **Quantification** of expression levels by counting alignments

### Today's goals 

I have performed the above steps for you already,
and you will start with an R object that contains the output of step 3:
a **gene count table**. Then, you will:

- Explore the data
- Perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Run a Differential Expression (DE) analysis
- Extract and visualize the DE results

## Getting set up

### Start an RStudio session at OSC

Start an RStudio session at OSC like we did last week and like you did for this
week's homework:

1. Log in to OSC at <https://ondemand.osc.edu>
2. Click on **`Interactive Apps`** (top bar) and then **`RStudio Server`**
   (all the way at the bottom)
3. Fill out the form as follows:
   - Cluster: **`Cardinal`**
   - R version: **`4.4.0`**
   - Project: **`PAS2880`**
   - Number of hours: **`4`**
   - Node type: **`any`**
   - Number of cores: **`2`**
4. Click the big blue **`Launch`** button at the bottom
5. Now, you should be sent to a new page with a box at the top for your
   RStudio Server "job", which should initially be "Queued" (waiting to start).
6. Your job should start running very soon,
   with the top bar of the box turning green and saying "Running".
7. Click **`Connect to RStudio Server`** at the bottom of the box,
   and an RStudio Server instance will open in a new browser tab.
   You're ready to go!

### Create an R script

Today, you're going to write most of your code in an R script instead of typing
it directly in the R console, as explained in the [R homework](r_homework.qmd):

1. Create and open a new R script by clicking
   **`File`** (top menu bar) \> **`New File`** \> **`R Script`**.

2. Save this new script right away by clicking **`File`** \> **`Save As`**.
   In the dialog box,
   you can save it right in the suggested folder (which is your OSC Home folder),
   or you can make a new folder for this course by clicking "New Folder" in
   the bottom left.
   Regardless, save the script as **`lab4_DE.R`**
   (the extension for R scripts is `.R`).

### Load the R packages you will use

As part of your homework, you installed a few R packages with functionality
you'll need in today's lab.

Recall that R packages behave equivalently to other software/apps,
in that installation is a one-time thing,
but you need to lead them in any given session to use them.
Let's start with that:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Then, load the R packages:
library(DESeq2)          # Differential expression analysis
library(EnhancedVolcano) # Volcano plot
library(tidyverse)       # Misc. data manipulation and plotting
```

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
Here, and with all the code in this lab,
type or copy it in your script, and send it to the console from there.
Recall that you can send code to the console by pressing
<kbd>**Ctrl**</kbd> **+** <kbd>**Enter**</kbd> on Windows,
or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> on a Mac.
:::

Running the code above will produce output in the R console, and some of it in orange,
but all should be good unless you see explicit errors at the bottom.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

```{r, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DESeq2)
library(EnhancedVolcano)
```

</details>

## Loading and exploring the data

The main analyses you'll perform today are a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and a Differential Expression (DE) analysis.
An R package that makes this relatively straightforward is **DESeq2**
(@love2014deseq2, 
[package website](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)),
which you installed as part of your homework, and loaded just now.

DESeq2 has its own "object type" (a specific R format type) and the first step
when working with this package is to create a DESeq2 object.
I already did this for you, so you can focus on the analysis itself.
The object consists of two main parts:

1. **Sample metadata** -- accessed with `colData()`\
   A table "mapping" samples to the groups they belong (here: treatment, time)
   
2. **Count table** -- accessed with `counts()`\
   A table with one row per gene, one column per sample, containing the gene counts
   
Let's load this DESeq2 object from a file.
It's stored in an R-specific format called an RDS file,
which you can load with the `readRDS()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# We give the object the name 'dds' (short for DESeqDataSet)
# (This is arbitrary and you could call it anything you want - but don't change it here.)
dds <- readRDS("/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703/results/dds.rds")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dds_file <- here::here("results/dds.rds")
dds <- readRDS(dds_file)
```

Let's see what's inside this DESeq2 object by simply typing its name:

```{r}
dds
```

That printed a summary of the object, with the following key items:

- **`class`**: The type of R object (here, `DESeqDataSet`)
- **`dim`**: The dimensions of the count table (genes x samples)
- **`rownames`**: The row names of the count table (here, gene IDs)
- **`colnames`**: The column names of the count table (here, sample IDs)
- **`colData names`**: The column names of the sample metadata table

_(`colData` is used as a shorthand for "column data", i.e. data associated with_
_the columns/samples of the count table.)_

### The sample metadata

Last week, we looked at the TSV file with the sample metadata (`metadata/meta.tsv`),
but we'll take a closer look at this same sample metadata now.
   
It can be accessed with the `colData()` function,
where we pass the name of our DESeq2 object as its argument:

```{r}
colData(dds)
```

This is collapsed, only showing the first 5 and last 5 rows with `...` in between.
If we want to see the entire table more easily,
we can first create a regular dataframe from it:

```{r}
# This turns the colData() output into a regular data frame and stores it in 'meta':
meta <- data.frame(colData(dds))
```

And then take a look e.g. with the `View()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# View() will open the dataframe in a spreadsheet like view
# Below on this website, it's just printed in full
View(meta)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
meta
```

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Interpret the metadata

Based on the information in the table, recap the study's experimental design.
How many timepoints and treatments are there?
How many biological replicates per group?

<details><summary>*Click to see the solution*</summary>

- The `dpi` column has the number of Days Post Infection
  (i.e., timepoints): either 1 or 10 days.
  You may remember from the lecture or the paper that there was also a 21-day
  timepoint, but I have removed those samples to keep things simpler.
  
- The `treatment` column contains the treatment:
  infection which *Plasmodium* species, or "control" (not infected).

- All in all, there are 3 treatments across each of 2 timepoints,
  with **3-4 biological replicates** per treatment-timepoint combination.
</details>
:::

### The count table

The gene count table inside the DESeq2 object can be accessed with the
`counts()` function:

```{r}
# We'll wrap it in head() to only see the first 6 rows (genes):
head(counts(dds))
```

This output may look confusing at a glance.
Only the first 6 rows (=genes) are printed, but because the table is quite wide,
the output is "folded".
Pay attention to the row (gene) names to understand it better.

We can directly count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) from this
count matrix -- these numbers should correspond to what we saw above:

```{r}
# Number of rows (genes):
nrow(counts(dds))

# Number of columns (samples):
ncol(counts(dds))
```

### Library sizes

The total number of gene counts per sample is called the **library size**.
This varies among samples for various reasons,
but we don't consider these differences to be biologically meaningful.
For example, if sample A has 10 million reads and sample B has 20 million reads,
we could _not_ conclude that sample B had "more expression".

<details><summary>Does this make sense to you or is it counter-intuitive?
&nbsp; <span style="color:darkolivegreen;">{{< fa comments >}}</span>
</summary>
</details>

How do the library sizes compare across samples?
To see this,
you can compute sums for each column (sample) using the `colSums()` function:

```{r}
colSums(counts(dds))
```

OK, lots of big numbers, so not that easy to read / interpret.
Let's manipulate that a bit:

- Convert the numbers to whole millions:
  divide by 1,000,000 and then round with `round()`
- Sorted the values (samples) from low to high with `sort()`

```{r}
sort(round(colSums(counts(dds)) / 1000000))
```

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

<details><summary>
Given what we just discussed:
If one sample has 9 million reads and another 28 million reads,
what implications does this have for comparing gene expression levels between them?
&nbsp; <span style="color:darkolivegreen;">{{< fa comments >}}</span>
</summary></details>

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Bonus: How many genes have non-zero counts? _(Click to expand)_

Perhaps surprisingly, the gene count table often contains genes
with zero counts across all samples:
it simply contains all genes in the genome.
In this dataset, how many genes have zero counts across all samples?

To compute this, first note that you can use `rowSums()` to compute total
counts per gene.

Then, you can make use of the following type of construct to count how many
times that sum is greater than a certain number, here 0:

```{r}
my_vec <- c(5, 0, 9)
my_vec > 0
sum(my_vec > 0)
```

So, the number of genes with non-zero total counts can be computed like so:

```{r}
sum(rowSums(counts(dds)) > 0)
```

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

<details><summary>
{{< fa user-edit >}} Your turn: How many genes have total counts of at least 10?
*(Click to see the solution)*
</summary>

```{r}
sum(rowSums(counts(dds)) > 9)
```
</details>

<details><summary>
{{< fa user-edit >}} Your turn: How many genes have *mean* counts of at least 10?
*(Click to see the solution)*
</summary>

Now you need to divide the count sums by the number of samples (`22`):

```{r}
sum(rowSums(counts(dds)) / 22 > 9)
```

An even more robust way to do this is to not "hard-code" the number of samples (`22`),
but to get it programmatically.
This is the number of columns, which you can get with `ncol()`

```{r}
sum(rowSums(counts(dds)) / ncol(counts(dds)) > 9)
```

</details>
:::

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

You will now run a PCA to look for overall patterns of (dis)similarity among samples.
This will help answer questions like:

- Do the samples cluster by treatment (infection status) and/or time point?
- Which of these two variables has a greater effect on overall patterns of gene expression?
- Is there an overall *interaction* between these two variables?

First, you have to normalize the count data to account for differences in
library size among samples and to "stabilize" the variance among genes[^4]:

[^4]: Specifically, the point is to remove the correlation among genes between the
      mean expression level and the variance in expression.

```{r}
dds_vst <- varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds)
```

The authors of the study did this as well:

> *We carried out a Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST) of the counts to represent the samples on a PCA plot.*

Next, you can run and plot the PCA with a single function call,
`plotPCA()` from DESeq2:

```{r}
# The 'intgroup' argument lets you pick the variables (columns) to color samples by
plotPCA(dds_vst, intgroup = c("dpi", "treatment"))
```

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Interpret the PCA result

1. Based on the above PCA plot, try to answer the three questions asked at the
   beginning of this PCA section.

2. How does the the PCA plot in the paper (Figure 1) compare?
   Would you draw similar conclusions? Do you see obvious differences?

   </details>
:::

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Bonus exercise 1: Number of genes in the PCA

By default, the PCA run by `plotPCA()` does not summarize the variation
in _all_ genes, but only in the top 500 most variable genes.
This tends to be a good representation of overall patterns,
but it can be a good idea to check how robust the results are to this choice.

The `plotPCA()` function has an argument to change the number of included genes.

1. Figure out what the name of this argument is by check the help for the function.\
   _(Hint: run `?plotPCA` in the R console)_

2. Play around with different numbers of included genes
   (e.g., 100, 1000, all genes) and see how this affects the PCA plot.
:::

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Bonus exercise 2: Make a better PCA plot

Customize the PCA plot to make it better-looking and clearer.

For example, in the plot we made above,
each combination of time point and treatment has a distinct color.
But it would be better to use **point color** only to distinguish one of the variables,
and **point shape** to distinguish the other variable,
as was done in the paper's Fig. 1.

To customize the plot, you'll first need to get the data in a format you can use
to build the plot from scratch.
Do this using the `returnData = TRUE` argument of the `plotPCA()` function
(check the first solution below if needed).

Then, the plot customization will require some knowledge of _ggplot2_.
If you don't know how to do this yet, but still want to try,
you can also try to use generative AI (Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
to help you write the code.

<details><summary>*Partial solution: getting the dataframe*</summary>

To be able to customize the plot properly,
it's best to build it from scratch ourselves,
rather than using the `plotPCA` function.
But then how do we get the input data in the right shape?

A nice trick is that we can use `returnData = TRUE` in the `plotPCA` function,
to get plot-ready formatted data instead of an actual plot:

```{r}
pca_df <- plotPCA(
  dds_vst,
  ntop = 500,
  intgroup = c("dpi", "treatment"),
  returnData = TRUE
  )
```

</details>

<details><summary>*Click to see a possible solution*</summary>

This starts from the `pca_df` dataframe created in the first solution above:

```{r}
ggplot(pca_df) +
  aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = treatment, shape = dpi) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2", name = "Infection status") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 13)
```

Finally, we may want to add the percentage of variance explained by each
principal component (PC) to the axes labels.
That can be done as follows:

```{r}
# First extract and store the percentage of variance explained by different
# principal components, so you can later add this information to the plot:
pct_var <- round(100 * attr(pca_df, "percentVar"), 1)
pct_var

# Remake the plot and customize the axes labels:
ggplot(pca_df) + 
  aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = treatment, shape = dpi) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  labs(
    x = paste0("PC1 (", pct_var[1], "%)"),
    y = paste0("PC2 (", pct_var[2], "%)")
    ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2", name = "Infection status") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 13)
```
</details>
:::

## Differential Expression (DE) analysis

### Figuring out how to do the analysis

First, let's see how the DE analysis was done in the paper:

> *Then, we used the DESeq2 package (Love et al., 2014) to perform the differential gene expression analysis comparing: (i) P. relictum-infected mosquitoes vs. controls, (ii) P. cathemerium-infected mosquitoes vs. controls, and (iii) P. relictum-infected mosquitoes vs. P. cathemerium-infected mosquitoes.*

This is not terribly detailed and could be interpreted in a couple of different ways.
For example, they may have compared infection statuses by *ignoring* time points
***or*** by *controlling for* time points in various ways.

Ignoring time would mean analyzing the full dataset (all time points)
while using the infection status as the only "independent variable",
i.e. using the design `~treatment`.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

<details><summary>
Given the PCA results, do you think we can ignore the `dpi` variable?
&nbsp; <span style="color:darkolivegreen;">{{< fa comments >}}</span>
</summary></details>

Controlling for time can be done in two ways:

- An analysis with two independent variables: `~ dpi + treatment`
- Pairwise comparisons between each combination of `dpi` and `treatment`

If you take a look at Table 1 with the DE results,
it should become clearer how they did their analysis:

![](../img/paper_table1.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

<details><summary>
How do you interpret this: did they run pairwise comparisons or a two-factor model?
&nbsp; <span style="color:darkolivegreen;">{{< fa comments >}}</span>
</summary></details>

Pairwise comparisons with more than independent variable can (also!) be done
in two ways:

- After **subsetting** the dataset to each combination of `dpi` and `treatment`.
- After creating a single, **combined independent variable** that is a
  combination of `dpi` and `treatment.`

It's not clear from the paper which they used,
but the latter method is the more common one, so we'll use that below.

### Setting the statistical design

You will now create a new variable that is a combination of `treatment` and `dpi`,
and call it `group`:

First, create a combined variable called `group` with the `paste()` function:

```{r}
group <- paste(dds$treatment, dds$dpi, sep = "_")
group
```

Next, turn this into a 'factor' and add it to the DESeq2 object
(factors are a common R data type for categorical variables,
and required by DESeq2):

```{r}
dds$group <- factor(group)
dds$group
```

As a quick sanity check:
which unique values does `group` have, and how many samples are in each?
Use the `table()` function for this:

```{r}
table(dds$group)
```

Lastly, set the analysis design by "adding" it to the DESeq2 object:

```{r}
# Note: the symbol before 'group' is a tilde, ~ 
design(dds) <- ~ group
```

Phew, now you're finally ready to run the DE analysis!

### Running the DE analysis

While you had to do a lot of prep to get here,
actually running the DE analysis is very simple.
It's done with the function `DESeq()`,
which we _only_ need to provide with the DESeq2 object,
since all the data and also the analysis options are specified in the object
itself:

```{r}
# (Note that the output is assigned back to the same `dds` object -
#  the DE results are added to it)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

The `DESeq()` function performs a bunch of steps consecutively, to:

1. "Normalize" the count data by library size and composition
2. Estimate of gene-wise variance in counts ("dispersion")
3. Fit the statistical model and calculate the test statistics

A key thing to understand is that above,
DESeq2 automatically performed pairwise comparisons between
each of the (6) levels of the `group` variable.
This means that for any individual gene, it tested whether the gene is
differentially expressed
**separately for each of these (15) pairwise comparisons**.

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Pairwise comparisons

Would you say we are interested in all 15 pairwise comparisons?

If you'd like to see all possible pairwise comparisons, use the following R code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
combn(unique(group), m = 2)
```

<details><summary>_Click to show the output of the code above_</summary>
<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />
```{r, echo=FALSE}
combn(unique(group), m = 2)
```

Each "column" in this ouput represents one pairwise comparison.

</details>

:::

::: callout-note
## Summary of statistical considerations for the DE analysis

1. **Gene count normalization** -- to fairly compare samples, raw gene counts must be adjusted:
   - By *library size*, the total number of gene counts per sample
   - By *library composition*, e.g. to correct for extremely abundant genes
     that "steal" most of a sample's counts

2. **Probability distribution of the count data**
   - Gene counts have a distribution similar to Poisson but with higher variance
     (the *negative binomial distribution* is typically used)
   - Variance estimates are gene-specific but "borrow" information from other genes ---\
     necessary in practice, but can make the analysis sensitive to false
     positives due to outliers (!)

3. **Multiple-testing correction**
   - 10,000+ genes are independently tested during a DE analysis,
     so multiple testing correction is needed!
   - The most common approach is the **Benjamini-Hochberg** (BH) method
     _([explanatory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8LQSvtjcEo))_
:::

## Extracting the DE results

DESeq2 stores the results as a separate table for each pairwise comparison.
Now, you'll extract one of these tables.

### The results table

You can extract the results for one pairwise comparison
(which DESeq2 refers to as a **contrast**) at a time,
by specifying it with the `contrast` argument as a vector of length 3:

1. The independent variable of interest (here, `group`)
2. The first (reference) level of the independent variable (in the example below, `relictum_1`)
3. The second level of the independent variable (in the example below, `control_1`)

```{r}
res_rc1 <- results(dds, contrast = c("group", "relictum_1", "control_1"))

head(res_rc1)
```

What do the columns in this table contain?

- **`baseMean`**: Mean expression level across all samples
- **`log2FoldChange`**: The "log2-fold change" of gene counts between the compared levels
- **`lfcSE`**: The uncertainty in terms of the standard error (SE) of the log2-fold change estimate
- **`stat`**: The value for the Wald test's test statistic
- **`pvalue`**: The *uncorrected* p-value from the Wald test
- **`padj`**: The multiple-testing corrected p-value (i.e., adjusted p-value)

### Log2-fold changes (LFCs)

In RNA-Seq analysis,
log2-fold changes (LFCs) are the standard way of representing the
**magnitude (*effect size*) of expression level differences**
between two groups of interest.
With A and B being the compared sample groups, the LFC is calculated as:

``` bash-out-solo
log2(mean of A / mean of B)
```

Due the log-transformation,
the LFC also increase more slowly than a raw fold-change:

- An LFC of **`1`** indicates a 2-fold difference
- An LFC of **`2`** indicates a 4-fold difference
- An LFC of **`3`** indicates a 8-fold difference

A nice property of LFC is that decreases and increases in expression are expressed symmetrically:

- An LFC of **`1`** means that group A has a **two-fold higher** expression that group B
- An LFC of **`-1`** means that group A has a **two-fold lower** expression that group B

### Numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

How many adjusted p-values were significant (less than 0.05)?

```{r}
# (We need 'na.rm = TRUE' because some p-values are 'NA')
# (If we don't remove NAs from the calculation, sum() will just return NA)
sum(res_rc1$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```

This means that you found `r sum(res_rc1$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)`
Differentially Expressed Genes (**DEG**s) for this specific pairwise comparison.

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: DEG numbers

## DE result visualizations

Finall, you'll create a few plots for the DE results you extracted above.

### Volcano plot

"Volcano plots" are a popular way to get a visual overview of DE results.
You'll do that here using the `EnhancedVolcano()` function
from the package of the same name
([see here for a "vignette" / tutorial](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/EnhancedVolcano/inst/doc/EnhancedVolcano.html)):

```{r, fig.height=6.5}
EnhancedVolcano(
  toptable = res_rc1,       # DESeq2 results to plot   
  x = "log2FoldChange",     # Plot the log2-fold change along the x-axis
  y = "padj",               # Plot the p-value along the y-axis
  title = "relictum vs. control at 24 hpi",  # Plot title
  lab = rownames(res_rc1),  # Use the rownames for the gene labels (though see below)
  labSize = 0               # Omit gene labels for now
  )
```

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Interpret the volcano plot

In the volcano plot, each gene is represented by a point.
Many points are on top of each other, so it may not look like there's thousand of them.
This is not necessarily a problem, because we're most interested in the overall patterns
and the "sparser areas" away from the origin.

1. What is shown along the y-axis? The higher a point is, the more...?
2. What is shown along the x-axis? The further away from zero a point is, the more...?
   Why does the x-axis have both negative and positive values?
3. What do the differently colored quadrants of the plot represent?

Based on the above:

4. Is the pattern with respect to log~2~-fold change symmetric,
   and if not, what does this mean?
5. Which points (genes) are the most interesting to follow up on, and why?
:::

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Bonus Exercise: Improve the Volcano Plot

The `EnhancedVolcano()` function by default adds gene IDs to highly significant
genes, but above, we turned off gene name labeling by setting `labSize = 0`.
I did this because the default p-value cut-off for point labeling is `1e-5` and
in this case, that would make the plot quite busy with gene labels.

We might want to try a plot with a stricter p-value cut-off that does show the
gene labels.
Play around with the p-value cut-off and the labeling to create a plot you like.

Check the package's explanatory
["vignette"](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/EnhancedVolcano/inst/doc/EnhancedVolcano.html)
or the function's help page (accessed by running `?EnhancedVolcano`)
to see how you can do this.

  lab = rownames(res_rc1), 
  labSize = 4,               # Now we will show the gene labels
  pCutoff = 10e-10,          # Modify the p-value cut-off
  subtitle = NULL,           # I'll also remove the silly subtitle
  caption = NULL,            # ... and the caption
  )

#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Bonus Exercise: Which gene is the outlier?

One gene has a _much_ higher log~2~-fold change than all the others.

Figure out the identity of this gene.
You can do so either by labeling it in the plot,
or by filtering the `res_rc1` table.

_(Interestingly, there's a second gene with a LFC \> 20 that we hadn't seen in the plot,_
_because it has `NA` as the `pvalue` and `padj`._
_See the section "Extra info: `NA` values in the results table" in the_
_[Appendix](#appendix-the-de-results) above for why p-values can be set to `NA`.)_

### Plot specific genes

It can also be very informative to plot expression levels for individual genes,
especially those with highly significant differential expression.

Let's plot the single most highly significant DEG.
We can get the ID of this gene as follows:

```{r}
# Convert the results table into a regular dataframe and sort by adjusted p-value:
top_df <- data.frame(res_rc1) |> arrange(padj)

# Gene IDs are the row names: extract the first row name to get the gene of interest
top1 <- rownames(top_df)[1]
top1
```

DESeq2 also has a built-in gene plotting function.
This will by default plot normalized gene counts.

```{r, fig.width=10.8, out.width="100%"}
# Like with the PlotPCA function, 'intgroup' specifies which variable to use for grouping:
plotCounts(dds, gene = top1, intgroup = "group")
```

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
You may have to drag the right-hand pane in RStudio way to the left in order
to see all the x-axis labels...
:::

In the above plot,
we're not just seeing the difference between `relictum_1` and `control_1`.
Expression levels are plotted for all treatment-time combinations.
That may not always be what you want,
but it can be rather useful to see the expression patterns across _all_ groups.

:::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Interpret the expression pattern

1. Does a visual "sniff test" support the statistical result that this gene is
   differentially expressed between `relictum_1` and `control_1`?

2. What other patterns do you see in the expression levels across treatment and time points?
   Can you think of any biological interpretations for these patterns?

Plot the gene with the very high LFC value that you saw when making

<details><summary>*Click to get the ID of the outlier gene*</summary>
A previous bonus exercise showed you how to find the ID of the outlier gene.
It is: `LOC120431476`.
</details>

<details><summary>*Click for the solution*</summary>

```{r, fig.width=11, out.width="100%"}
plotCounts(dds, gene = "LOC120431476", intgroup = "group")
```

Wow! It looks like in every single dpi + treatment combination,
all but one (or in one case, two) of the samples have zero expression,
but there are several extreme outliers.

Our focal comparison is `control_1` vs. `relictum_1`,
and it looks like the difference between these two groups is solely due to the one
outlier in `relictum`.
Nevertheless, even the multiple-testing corrected p-value (`padj`) is
significant for this gene:

```{r}
as.data.frame(res_rc1) |>
  rownames_to_column("gene") |>
  filter(gene == "LOC120431476")
```

So, you have to be careful with talking these statistical results at face value,
and need to visualize important genes!

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Bonus exercise: Make a better gene expression plot

The default `plotCounts()` function creates a rather basic plot.
Customize the plot with _ggplot2_ to make it better-looking and clearer.

<details><summary>*Solution part 1: getting the dataframe*</summary>

Below, you'll use that DESeq2 function, but only to extract the counts for our gene
of interest in a format for plotting, by adding `returnData = TRUE`:

```{r}
# Use plotCounts with returnData = TRUE just to get a single-gene count table
# that is suitable for plotting:
focal_gene_counts <- plotCounts(
  dds,
  gene = top1,
  intgroup = c("dpi", "treatment"),
  returnData = TRUE
  )

# Take a look at the resulting dataframe:
head(focal_gene_counts)
```

  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = count, fill = treatment)) +
  # Plot separate "facets" with the different time points
  facet_wrap(vars(dpi)) +
  # Add a boxplot with a partly transparaent (alpha) color:
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, outlier.shape = NA) +
  # _And_ add individual points:
  geom_point(
    size = 4,
    shape = 21,
    position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, heigth = 0)
    ) +

## In Closing

Today, you have performed several steps in the analysis of gene counts that
result from a typical RNA-Seq workflow. Specifically, you have:

- Explore the RNA-Seq gene expression data in a DESEq2 object
- Performed Principal Component Analysis
- Ran a Differential Expression (DE) analysis with DESeq2
- Extracted, interpreted, and visualized the DE results

#### What would be the next steps in such an analysis?

Typical next steps in such an analysis include:

- Additional summaries and plots can be made, such as heatmaps (see the Appendix below)

- Extracting, comparing, and synthesizing DE results across **all pairwise comparisons**
  (this would for example allow us to make the upset plot in *Figure 2 of the paper*)

- **Functional enrichment analysis** with Gene Ontology (GO) terms,
  as done in the paper, and/or with KEGG pathways.

## Appendix

### A heatmap

Rather than plotting expression levels for many individual genes,
you can create "heatmap" plots to plot dozens (possibly even hundreds) of genes at once.

We will create heatmaps with the `pheatmap` function,
and let's make a heatmap for the top-25 most highly significant DEGs for the
focal contrast. First, let's install and then load this package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install the pheatmap package [Output not shown]:
install.packages("pheatmap")
```

```{r}
# Load the pheatmap package:
library(pheatmap)
```

Unlike with some of the functions we used before,
we unfortunately can't directly use our DESeq2 object,
but we have to extract and subset the count matrix,
and also pass the metadata to the heatmap function:

```{r}
# You need a normalized count matrix, like for the PCA
# You can extract the matrix from the normalized dds object we created for the PCA
# with the assay() function
norm_mat <- assay(dds_vst)

# In the normalized count matrix, select only the genes of interest
# We'll create a vector with the top256 most significant DEGs
top25_DE <- rownames(top_df)[1:25]
norm_mat_sel <- norm_mat[match(top25_DE, rownames(norm_mat)), ]
```

The plot will respect the order of samples in the count matrix,
so let's sort the metadata and then the count matrix sensibly:

```{r}
# Sort the metadata
meta_sort <- meta |> arrange(treatment, dpi)

# Sort the columns in the normalized count matrix to match the metadata
norm_mat_sel <- norm_mat_sel[, rownames(meta_sort)]
```

Now you can create the plot:

```{r}
pheatmap(
  norm_mat_sel,
  annotation_col = meta_sort,  # Add the metadata
  cluster_cols = FALSE,        # Don't cluster samples (=columns, cols)
  show_rownames = FALSE,       # Don't show gene names
  scale = "row",               # Perform z-scaling for each gene
  )
```

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
- The z-scaling with `scale =` will make sure we can compare genes with
  very different expression levels: after all,
  we're interested in relative expression levels across samples/sample groups

- `pheatmap` will by default perform hierarchical clustering both at the sample
  (`col`) and gene (`row`) level,
  such that more similar samples and genes will appear closer to each other.
  Above, we turned clustering off for samples to keep them in their groupwise order.

### Exporting the results

You may be wondering how you can save the DE results tables to files.
You can do this with the function `write_tsv()`.
This stores the table to a TSV text file, which can be opened in Excel. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Write the results table to a TSV file:
write_tsv(as.data.frame(res_rc1), "DE-results_rc1.tsv")
```
