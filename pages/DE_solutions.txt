- The `dpi` column has the number of Days Post Infection
  (i.e., timepoints): either 1 or 10 days.
  You may remember from the lecture or the paper that there was also a 21-day
  timepoint, but I have removed those samples to keep things simpler.
  
- The `treatment` column contains the treatment:
  infection which *Plasmodium* species, or "control" (not infected).

- All in all, there are 3 treatments across each of 2 timepoints,
  with **3-4 biological replicates** per treatment-timepoint combination.

We can directly count the number of rows (genes) and columns (samples) from this
count matrix -- these numbers should correspond to what we saw above:

```{r}
# Number of rows (genes):
nrow(counts(dds))

# Number of columns (samples):
ncol(counts(dds))
```
