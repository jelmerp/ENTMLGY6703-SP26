## Long-read HTS

The technologies underlying the two main long-read HTS technologies are very different,
but have some commonalities beyond long reads — they:

- Perform **"single-molecule" sequencing** (no PCR amplification of library fragments)
- Require higher quality & quantity of DNA (because of the lack of PCR)
- Can detect some **base modifications**, like methyl groups

## Error rates are changing

I mentioned earlier that long-read HTS has higher error rate than short-read (Illumina) HTS.

However, error rates in one type of PacBio sequencing where individual fragments
are sequenced multiple times ("HiFi") *are now lower than in Illumina*.

## Nanopore sequencing

**A single strand of DNA passes through a nanopore** —\
the *electrical current* is measured, which depends on the combination of bases passes in the pore:

## Under development!

ONT constantly releases new flow cells with updated technology,
which have led to large decreases in error rates over the past decade ---
and even over the past two or so years.
