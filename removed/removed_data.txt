#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Exploring the assembly FASTA file with `grep`

`grep` is an incredibly useful Unix command with which you can search files
for specific text. By default, it will print lines that match your search in their entirety.

For example, you could search the genome for the short sequence `ACCGATACGACG`:

```bash
grep "ACCGATACGACG" data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.fna
# (When you run this, matches should be highlighted in red,
#  but that doesn't show here on the website, unfortunately.)
```
```bash-out
aaaatcgaaaaacgcgTTTACCTTACATTGACAAAGTTGACCGATACGACGGCTCGATGTGCCAAACCGGTCACAAAGTC
AATATTGACATTTCTTTTGCATTCTTCAGGTTCAGTGACCACAAACGGGACCGATACGACGGCTACCATCGGAATGCACC
TCAAAATGTGTCAATTAACGTAACTAGATTTTTACGATCATAATAAGTAGATACCGATACGACGGGGCGGCATTTATGCT
TAAGTAGATACCGATACGACGGGGCGGCATTCATGCTGCTACAGGGCTCAGCGGACCGACAAGCGACTGTGAAACGCAGC
```

Or count the number of times the much shorter sequence `GGACC` occurs:

```bash
grep -c "GGACC" data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.fna
```
```bash-out
120492
```

**Try to adapt the above example in order to:**

1. Print all entry headers in the assembly FASTA file
2. Count the number of entry header (= the number of entries) in the assembly FASTA file

Does the number of entries make sense given how many chromosomes and scaffolds
the assembly consists of according to NCBI?

To print all FASTA entry headers,
simply search for `>` with `grep`
(since `>` should not occur in the sequences themselves,
which can only be bases or `N`). Make sure to uses quotes (`">"`)!

```bash
grep ">" data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.fna
```
```bash-out
>NC_068937.1 Culex pipiens pallens isolate TS chromosome 1, TS_CPP_V2, whole genome shotgun sequence
>NC_068938.1 Culex pipiens pallens isolate TS chromosome 2, TS_CPP_V2, whole genome shotgun sequence
>NC_068939.1 Culex pipiens pallens isolate TS chromosome 3, TS_CPP_V2, whole genome shotgun sequence
>NW_026292818.1 Culex pipiens pallens isolate TS unplaced genomic scaffold, TS_CPP_V2 Cpp_Un0001, whole genome shotgun sequence
>NW_026292819.1 Culex pipiens pallens isolate TS unplaced genomic scaffold, TS_CPP_V2 Cpp_Un0002, whole genome shotgun sequence
>NW_026292820.1 Culex pipiens pallens isolate TS unplaced genomic scaffold, TS_CPP_V2 Cpp_Un0003, whole genome shotgun sequence
>NW_026292821.1 Culex pipiens pallens isolate TS unplaced genomic scaffold, TS_CPP_V2 Cpp_Un0004, whole genome shotgun sequence
[...truncated...]
```

You can count the number of header lines by modifying the above command simply
with the addition of the `-c` option:

```bash
grep -c ">" data/ref/GCF_016801865.2.fna
```
```bash-out
290
```
