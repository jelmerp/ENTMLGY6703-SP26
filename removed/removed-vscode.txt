## The VS Code text editor

### What is VS Code?

VS Code is basically a fancy text editor,
with an integrated terminal that runs a Unix shell.
In these labs:

- VS Code will be our editor for Unix shell code (this week)
- RStudio will be our editor for R (next week's lab)

### Starting a VS Code session

Interactive Apps like VS Code and RStudio **run on compute nodes** (not login nodes).
Because compute nodes always need to be "reserved" to be used,
you have to fill out a form and specify the following details:

- The **Cluster** we want to use: `pitzer`
- The **Account**, the OSC Project to be billed for the compute node usage: `PAS2880`
- The **Number of hours** we want to make a reservation for: `4`
- The **Working Directory** (starting point) for the program:
  `/fs/scratch/PAS2880/ENT6703`
- [The **App Code Server version**: `4.8.3` (this should be the only available option)]{style="color:#969696"}

![This is how you should fill out the form to start a VS Code session](../img/ondemand_vscode_form.png){fig-align="center" width="65%" fig-alt="A screenshot of OSC OnDemand VS Code form." .lightbox}

Click `Launch` and you'll be sent to the _My Interactive Sessions_ page
with a card for your job at the top.
First, your job may be *Queued* for some seconds
(i.e., waiting for computing resources to be assigned to it),
but it should soon switch to *Starting* and then to *Running*:

Once the blue **Connect to VS Code** button appears,
click that and VS Code will open in a new browser tab.
When VS Code opens, you may get these two pop-ups (and possibly some others):

::: columns
::: {.column width="52%"}

### The VS Code User Interface

#### Editor pane and "Get Started" document

The main part of the VS Code is the **editor pane**.
Here, you can open files like scripts and other types of text files, and images.
Right now, you should see a Get Started page --
you don't have to go through any steps that may be suggested there.
  
#### Side bars

The **Activity Bar** (narrow side bar) on the far left has:

- A {{< fa bars >}} ("hamburger menu"),
  which has menu items like `File` that you often find in a top bar
- A {{< fa cog >}} (cog wheel icon) in the bottom,
  through which you can mainly access *settings*
- Icons to toggle **(wide) Side Bar** options --
  but we'll only use the default selection, the *Explorer* (file browser)

#### Terminal (with a Unix shell)

**Open a terminal** by clicking  {{< fa bars >}}   =\> `Terminal` =\> `New Terminal`.
We'll start using this in the next section!

#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Try a few color themes

1.  Access the "Color Themes" option by clicking <i class="fa fa-cog"></i>   =\> `Color Theme`.
2.  Try out a few themes and see what you like!
