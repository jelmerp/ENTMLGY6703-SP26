### `arrange()` to sort data frames

The `arrange()` function is like sorting functionality in Excel:
it changes the order of rows based on the values in one or more columns^[
It will always rearrange the order of rows as a whole,
never just of individual columns since that would scramble the data.
].

The `meta` dataframe is currently first sorted by `time` and then by `treatment`,
whereas `sample_id`s within these groups are not sorted.
You may, for example, want to sort by `sample_id` instead:

```{r}
meta |>
  arrange(sample_id)
```


Let's see a few more examples.
As vectors can consist of just a single item,
each of the two lines of code below creates a vector:

```{r}
vector1 <- 8
vector2 <- "panda"
```

`"panda"` is a single item (not 5 - its number of letters,
and because it's a non-numeric value, has to be quoted.
