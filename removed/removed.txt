## Here is how you could use commands download the files to OSC directly (Click to expand)

-   First you download the files. This is copied from the code provided on the NCBI website when you click `curl` — however, that code needs to be preceded by the `curl` and followed by `> ncbi_dataset.zip`:

``` bash
curl https://api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/v2alpha/genome/accession/GCF_945859705.1/download?include_annotation_type=GENOME_FASTA,GENOME_GFF,RNA_FASTA,CDS_FASTA,PROT_FASTA,SEQUENCE_REPORT > ncbi_dataset.zip
```

-   Next, you'll want to extract the ZIP archive that you downloaded:

``` bash
unzip ncbi_dataset.zip
```

-   Now the files should be there — you can use the `tree` command instead of `ls` to get a nice recursive overview:

``` bash
tree ncbi_dataset
```

``` bash-out
ncbi_dataset/

#### Side note: "I don't think I like coding. Can I avoid all of this?" *(Click to expand)*

If you will often be doing HTS/genomics projects like the ones mentioned above,
it's hard to avoid using this (kind of) infrastructure.
But especially if you're only doing a single project like this,
you might avoid it by:

- Outsourcing part of the analysis:
  companies or service cores can often do the more standardized,
  compute-heavy parts for you
- Trying a platform like [***Galaxy***](https://usegalaxy.org),
  which has a web browser interface and doesn't require coding

Finally, generative AI tools are becoming increasingly capable of
writing code for you based on your instructions,
and may spurn additional no-code or low-code solutions in the future.
